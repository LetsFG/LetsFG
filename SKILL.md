# SKILL.md — LetsFG Capabilities

> **MPP:** a card-free *enrolment* lane for agents holding a Tempo wallet is
> offered only when the `402` from `POST /api/agent-access/request` carries an
> `mpp` object. It costs **$0.01 once**, as verification only. Search stays free
> and booking costs the price on the offer. Earlier revisions of this page
> described an MPP charge at *unlock* time; that never shipped. See
> <https://letsfg.co/for-agents>.

> ### ⚠️ Agents: do not create a Developer API account
>
> Do **NOT** call `/developers/api/v1/agents/register` or
> `/developers/api/v1/agents/setup-payment`, and do **NOT** run
> `letsfg register` or `letsfg setup-payment`. Those belong to a separate,
> paid, prepaid-balance product for high-volume commercial integrations and
> create a billing account you almost certainly do not want.
>
> To search and book flights, connect LetsFG as an MCP server at
> `https://letsfg.co/developers/api/mcp` and approve it — the consent step saves
> a card at <https://letsfg.co/connect> (nothing charged). Then search and book.
> See <https://letsfg.co/for-agents>.

## Skills

### search_flights
Search hundreds of airlines AND the major booking sites (Google Flights, Skyscanner, Kiwi, Kayak, Momondo) in one call. Returns real-time prices plus per-flight reliability history.
- **Cost:** FREE (unlimited)
- **Input:** origin (IATA), destination (IATA), date_from, optional: date_to, return_from, return_to, adults, children, infants, cabin_class (M/W/C/F), max_stopovers, currency, sort, limit
- **Output:** List of flight offers with price, airlines, times, segments, conditions, passenger_ids
- **Note:** On PFS (Bearer token), call `book_flight` directly — no unlock step — then poll `get_flight_booking`. On the Developer API, offers must be unlocked before booking.
- **Rate limit (PFS):** 10 searches per 10 min, 30 per hour, 100 per day, per card. Polling results never counts.

### resolve_hotel_city
Resolve a place name to the supplier city id that hotel search needs.
- **Cost:** FREE (a card must still be on file)
- **Endpoint:** `POST /api/v1/hotels/destinations`
- **Input:** text (place name, e.g. "Warsaw")
- **Output:** Matches, best first. Use `Id` as city_id and `Name` as city_name.

### search_hotels
Search real, bookable hotel inventory.
- **Cost:** FREE, but a payment method on file is REQUIRED — for search, not just booking. A hotel
  search opens a real session at the supplier, so it returns HTTP 402 without a card.
- **Auth:** Either a Developer API key (`X-API-Key`) or the PFS card-backed token from the connect flow. The same card authorises flights and hotels.
- **Endpoint:** `POST /api/v1/hotels/search`
- **Input:** city_id, city_name, check_in, check_out, adults, children, child_ages, nationality, limit
- **Output:** hotels[] each with offers[] carrying `price` (what the guest pays),
  `reservation_fee_now` (the 5%), `balance_to_supplier`, `balance_due_by`,
  `free_cancellation_until`, `combination_id_v2`
- **Note:** Only free-cancellation, pay-later rates are sold, so the result set is smaller than a
  metasearch and every rate returned can actually be booked. Keep `session_id` and the chosen
  offer's `combination_id_v2` — booking needs both.

### search_transfers
Search ground transfers — private cars, taxis, shared shuttles, airport express.
- **Cost:** FREE
- **Input:** origin, destination, date, passengers
- **Output:** Transfer options with prices and vehicle types

### search_activities
Search activities — tours, museum tickets, day trips via direct APIs and aggregators.
- **Cost:** FREE
- **Input:** location, date_from, date_to
- **Output:** Activity options with prices, descriptions, availability

### resolve_location
Resolve city names to IATA airport/city codes.
- **Cost:** FREE
- **Input:** query (city name, e.g. "London")
- **Output:** List of matching IATA codes (e.g. LON, LHR, LGW, STN, LTN, LCY)

### unlock_flight_offer
Confirm live price with airline and reveal the direct booking URL. Reserves the offer for 30 minutes.
- **Developer API only.** There is no unlock step on a PFS Bearer token: call `/api/agent-book` instead. Legacy path — not part of the agent flow.
- **Endpoint:** `POST /api/v1/bookings/unlock`
- **Input:** offer_id from search results (only required parameter)
- **Output:** confirmed_price, confirmed_currency, booking_url, offer_expires_at
- **Prerequisite:** A payment method on file (`setup_payment`) on the Developer API account.
- **HTTP 402:** No card on file. With MPP support, response carries a `WWW-Authenticate: Payment` challenge — pay via Tempo USDC.e and retry. Otherwise add a card via `setup_payment`.
- **HTTP 410:** Offer expired — airline sold the seats, search again (OfferExpiredError)
- **Note:** confirmed_price may differ from search price (airline prices change in real-time). After unlock, you have 30 minutes to complete the booking. If the window expires, search again (free) and unlock again.
- **Python:** `unlocked = bt.unlock(offer_id)` → returns UnlockResult
- **CLI:** `letsfg unlock off_xxx`
- **JS/TS:** `const unlocked = await bt.unlock(offerId)`

### book_flight
Book an offer.
- **PFS (Bearer token):** `POST /api/agent-book`. No unlock step — search, then book directly.
  Works for every offer in the results, whichever seller it came from. Exactly what the website
  checkout does: the fare plus LetsFG's markup is **held** on the connected card (not taken), a
  LetsFG booking agent buys the ticket from the seller, and the hold is captured only once a real
  airline PNR exists. If the booking fails the hold is released and nothing is charged.
  - **Input:** `search_id` + `offer_id` exactly as search returned them (offers expire ~15 min),
    `contact_email`, and ONE `passenger` per call: given_name, family_name, born_on, gender (m/f),
    nationality (ISO-2), phone_number + phone_country, address_line1, address_city,
    address_postal, address_country; passport_number/country/expiry optional.
  - **Output (seconds):** `{"state": "booking_in_progress", "booking_ref": "eyJ...",
    "held": {"amount": 93, "currency": "EUR", "card": "visa ending 5709"}, "charged": 0}`.
    The booking itself takes 4–11 minutes — poll `get_flight_booking`.
  - **Nothing charged on:** `{"error": "missing_details", "missing_fields": [...]}` (ask, call again),
    `payment_method_required` and `payment_declined` (both carry `add_card_url`: https://letsfg.co/connect).
  - Never call it twice for the same trip while one is in progress — that places a second hold.
  - **CLI:** `letsfg book ws_off_xxx --search-id ws_xxx --passenger '{...}' --email you@example.com`
  - **Python:** `bt.book(offer_id=..., passengers=[{...}], contact_email=..., search_id=...)`
- **Developer API:** Requires `unlock` first. Creates a real airline reservation with PNR code, and
  charges the ticket price to the card on the Developer API account before booking.
  - **Prerequisite:** Payment method must be attached via `setup_payment` first.
  - **Input:** offer_id, passengers (id, given_name, family_name, born_on, gender, title, email, phone_number), contact_email
  - **Output:** booking_reference (airline PNR), status, flight_price, currency
  - **Payment flow:** the card is charged the ticket price → LetsFG books via the airline → you get the PNR. If the airline booking fails, you are automatically refunded.
- **CRITICAL (both paths):** Use real passenger names (must match passport/ID) and real email (airline sends e-ticket there).

### get_flight_booking
Where a booking started by `book_flight` has got to (PFS). `POST /api/agent-book/status {"booking_ref": "eyJ..."}`.
- **Cost:** FREE. Poll every 20–30 s.
- **States:** `booking_in_progress` (the agent is at the seller's checkout — keep waiting) →
  `completed` (`pnr`, `charged_amount`, `currency` — booked) | `failed` (`failure_reason`; the hold was
  released, nothing charged) | `needs_attention` (a human at LetsFG is checking it — do NOT book again;
  the traveller will be emailed). `updated_at_ms` says when it last moved.
- Only `completed` with a PNR means booked.

### book_hotel
Start a hotel booking. Returns a job, NOT a booking.
- **Cost:** 5% of the price charged immediately to the card on file as a NON-REFUNDABLE
  reservation fee. The balance is paid directly to the supplier through the returned `pay_link`.
- **Endpoint:** `POST /api/v1/hotels/book`
- **Input:** session_id, hotel_code, combination_id_v2, expected_price, expected_balance, city_id,
  city_name, check_in, check_out, adults, guests[{title, first_name, last_name}], email, phone
- **Output:** booking_job_id, status "in_progress", poll URL
- **Asynchronous:** a real booking takes minutes — the rate is re-blocked at the supplier, the card
  charged, the room committed. Poll `get_hotel_booking` until status is `succeeded` or `failed`.
  This is what makes it impossible to charge a card and then lose the confirmation to a timeout.
- **CRITICAL:** send `expected_price` and `expected_balance` back exactly as search returned them,
  or the booking is refused as a price mismatch — a guest is never charged a price they did not
  agree to.
- **CRITICAL:** NOT idempotent. Calling this twice for the same rate books the room twice and
  charges two reservation fees. If a call times out, poll the job; do not re-book.
- **Note:** the fee is charged BEFORE the room is committed, so a declined card costs nothing —
  no reservation exists and nothing is charged.

### get_hotel_booking
Collect the result of a booking started with `book_hotel`.
- **Cost:** FREE
- **Endpoint:** `GET /api/v1/hotels/booking/{booking_job_id}`
- **Output:** status, and on success confirmation, reservation_fee_charged, pay_link, balance_due,
  balance_due_by, terms (including the full cancellation ladder)
- **Note:** `balance_due_by` is the supplier's own auto-cancellation date, not advisory. Miss it and
  the room is released.

### cancel_hotel_booking
Release a hotel reservation.
- **Cost:** Free until `balance_due_by`; after that the hotel's own ladder applies and can reach
  100%. The 5% reservation fee is NOT refunded.
- **Endpoint:** `POST /api/v1/hotels/cancel`
- **Input:** confirmation
- **Output:** confirmation, charge
- **Note:** drives a browser at the supplier and takes over a minute. If it times out, do NOT
  assume it failed — re-check before retrying.

### register
Register a new AI agent.
- **Cost:** FREE
- **Input:** agent_name, email
- **Output:** api_key (permanent credential)

### setup_payment
**Developer API only.** Attach a payment card to a prepaid Developer API account. Agents on the
PFS lane do not call this — their card is saved at <https://letsfg.co/connect> during the MCP
connect step.
- **Cost:** FREE (attaching the card is free; you are charged the ticket price when you book)
- **Input:** token or payment_method_id or card details
- **Output:** Payment status confirmation
- **Note:** Once per Developer API account. The card stays on file for future bookings.

### get_agent_profile
Get current agent's profile, usage stats, and payment status.
- **Cost:** FREE
- **Output:** Agent details, search count, booking count, payment status

## Authentication

**PFS (recommended — almost every agent):** a card-backed Bearer token. Nothing
is charged to connect: the card is saved in a 0.00 Revolut setup at
<https://letsfg.co/connect> (any card, or Revolut Pay / Google Pay; no Revolut
account needed; card details never touch LetsFG). Search, flight booking and
hotels all work with it.

```
Authorization: Bearer eyJ...
```

Get a token — the one way in:

1. Add LetsFG as a remote MCP server: `https://letsfg.co/developers/api/mcp`.
2. Approve the connection. The OAuth consent step opens
   <https://letsfg.co/connect>, where the person adds a card or pays 0.00 with
   Revolut Pay / Google Pay.
3. The OAuth token you receive is card-backed. Over the MCP it is carried for
   you; over raw HTTP send it as `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.

`POST /api/agent-access/request` answers `402` with these steps as JSON
(`add_card_url`, `how`). The Stripe enrolment lanes (`setup_url`, `setup_intent`,
`card_token`) were retired on 2026-09-02 and every token they issued was revoked
(`401 TOKEN_REVOKED`; `/api/agent-access/verify` answers `410` for a Stripe
credential) — reconnect at letsfg.co/connect. `letsfg auth` still runs that
retired flow and cannot mint a token; the CLI and SDKs read the token from
`LETSFG_BEARER_TOKEN`. One card = one account; quotas are per card. Full flow:
<https://letsfg.co/for-agents>.

**Developer API (business / high-volume):** every endpoint except `register`
requires an `X-API-Key` header.

```
X-API-Key: letsfg_...
```

Get your key by calling `POST /api/v1/agents/register` with agent_name and email. The key is permanent — save it once.

Before your first unlock, attach a payment method via `POST /api/v1/agents/setup-payment`.

## Complete Workflow

### Flight Booking — PFS (3 API calls)

```
1. POST /api/search                    → Search flights (FREE), returns search_id; poll GET /api/results/{search_id}
2. POST /api/agent-book                → Book directly — no unlock step. Holds the fare on the connected card, returns booking_ref in seconds
3. POST /api/agent-book/status         → Poll every 20–30 s (4–11 min) → completed (PNR) | failed (hold released) | needs_attention
```

### Flight Booking — Developer API (5 API calls)

```
1. POST /api/v1/agents/register        → Get API key (once)
2. POST /api/v1/agents/setup-payment   → Attach payment card (once)
3. POST /api/v1/flights/search         → Search flights (FREE)
4. POST /api/v1/bookings/unlock        → Unlock offer (legacy, Developer API only) → returns booking_url
5. POST /api/v1/bookings/book          → Book flight (ticket price charged to the card on the account)
```

### Hotel Booking (PFS Bearer token or Developer API key — the same card authorises both)

```
1. Card on file                            → PFS: saved at letsfg.co/connect; Developer API: POST /api/v1/agents/setup-payment. Required for SEARCH too
2. POST /api/v1/hotels/destinations        → Place name → city_id
3. POST /api/v1/hotels/search              → Bookable rates (free, card still required)
4. POST /api/v1/hotels/book                → Returns booking_job_id — NOT a booking
5. GET  /api/v1/hotels/booking/{job_id}    → Poll ~20s until succeeded/failed
                                             → confirmation + pay_link + balance_due_by
6. POST /api/v1/hotels/cancel              → Optional; free until balance_due_by
```

5% is charged to the card at step 4 as a non-refundable reservation fee; the balance is paid
directly to the supplier through `pay_link` by `balance_due_by`, which is the supplier's own
auto-cancellation date. Never repeat step 4 for the same rate — that books the room twice.

## CLI Usage

```bash
pip install letsfg

export LETSFG_BEARER_TOKEN=eyJ...   # card-backed token from the connect flow (see Authentication)

# Search flights — prints search_id, needed for book
letsfg search LHR JFK 2026-04-15
letsfg search LON BCN 2026-04-01 --return 2026-04-08 --cabin C --sort price
letsfg search GDN BER 2026-05-10 --adults 2 --children 1

# Resolve locations
letsfg locations "New York"

# Book — price shown on the offer, no unlock step. Holds the fare on the connected
# card and prints a booking_ref; poll POST /api/agent-book/status every 20–30 s
letsfg book ws_off_xxx --search-id ws_xxx \
  --passenger '{"given_name":"John","family_name":"Doe","born_on":"1990-01-15","gender":"m","nationality":"GB","phone_number":"+447123456789","phone_country":"GB","address_line1":"1 High St","address_city":"London","address_postal":"N1 9GU","address_country":"GB"}' \
  --email john.doe@example.com

# Machine-readable output
letsfg search GDN BER 2026-03-03 --json
```

Developer API instead? `letsfg register` + `letsfg setup-payment` once, then
`letsfg search ... --api-key letsfg_...`, `letsfg unlock off_xxx --api-key letsfg_...`,
`letsfg book off_xxx --api-key letsfg_... --passenger '{"id":"pas_0",...}' --email ...`.

## Python SDK Usage

```python
from letsfg import LetsFG

bt = LetsFG()  # reads LETSFG_BEARER_TOKEN — the card-backed token from the connect flow

# Search
results = bt.search("LHR", "JFK", "2026-04-15")
for offer in results.offers:
    print(f"{offer.price} {offer.currency} — {', '.join(offer.airlines)}")

# Book — price shown on the offer, no unlock step. Holds the fare on the
# connected card; a LetsFG agent buys the ticket; captured only on a real PNR.
result = bt.book(
    offer_id=results.offers[0].id,
    passengers=[{
        "given_name": "John", "family_name": "Doe",
        "born_on": "1990-01-15", "gender": "m", "nationality": "GB",
        "phone_number": "+447123456789", "phone_country": "GB",
        "address_line1": "1 High St", "address_city": "London",
        "address_postal": "N1 9GU", "address_country": "GB",
    }],
    contact_email="john@example.com",
    search_id=results.search_id,
)
if "missing_fields" in result:
    print("Nothing charged — ask for:", result["missing_fields"])
else:
    print("Started:", result["booking_ref"], result["held"])
    # poll POST /api/agent-book/status {"booking_ref": ...} every 20–30 s
    # until state is completed (pnr) | failed (hold released) | needs_attention
```

Developer API instead? `LetsFG(api_key="letsfg_...")`, then `bt.unlock(offer_id)`
before `bt.book(...)` — returns a `BookingResult` with `booking_reference` (PNR).

## MCP Server Setup

**Remote (Streamable HTTP) — the way in for agents:**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "letsfg": { "url": "https://letsfg.co/developers/api/mcp" }
  }
}
```

Claude Code: `claude mcp add --transport http letsfg https://letsfg.co/developers/api/mcp`.
claude.ai / ChatGPT: add a custom connector with that URL. Windsurf uses
`"serverUrl"` instead of `"url"`. The client runs OAuth; the consent step opens
<https://letsfg.co/connect> where the person saves a card (0.00, nothing
charged). The token the client receives is card-backed and can search and book.
Developer API accounts can use the same URL with
`"headers": {"X-API-Key": "letsfg_..."}` instead of OAuth.

**Local (stdio) — needs a token you already hold:**

```bash
npm install -g letsfg-mcp
LETSFG_BEARER_TOKEN=eyJ...  letsfg-mcp   # card-backed token from the connect flow
```

The local server also accepts `LETSFG_API_KEY` instead, for the Developer API.
`book_flight` dispatches automatically based on which one is set. Its
`authenticate` tool still runs the retired Stripe setup and cannot mint a token.

## Error Handling

| Exception | HTTP Code | When |
|-----------|-----------|------|
| `AuthenticationError` | 401 | Invalid or missing API key |
| `PaymentRequiredError` | 402 | No payment method (legacy flow) |
| `OfferExpiredError` | 410 | Offer no longer available |
| `LetsFGError` | 422 | Invalid request parameters |
| `LetsFGError` | 429 | Too many requests (retry with backoff) |
| `LetsFGError` | 502 | Upstream airline/hotel API error |

### Authentication Failure Recovery

```python
from letsfg import LetsFG
from letsfg.connectors.auth import BearerTokenError

try:
    bt = LetsFG()  # reads LETSFG_BEARER_TOKEN — the card-backed token from the connect flow
    flights = bt.search("LHR", "JFK", "2026-04-15")
except BearerTokenError:
    print("Token expired, revoked or missing — reconnect at https://letsfg.co/connect")
```

Developer API:

```python
from letsfg import LetsFG, AuthenticationError

try:
    bt = LetsFG(api_key="letsfg_...")
    flights = bt.search("LHR", "JFK", "2026-04-15")
except AuthenticationError:
    # API key invalid or expired — re-register
    creds = LetsFG.register("my-agent", "agent@example.com")
    bt = LetsFG(api_key=creds["api_key"])
    bt.setup_payment(token="...")  # re-attach payment on the new key
```

### Rate Limit and Timeout Handling

```python
import time
from letsfg import LetsFG, LetsFGError

def search_with_retry(bt, origin, dest, date, max_retries=3):
    for attempt in range(max_retries):
        try:
            return bt.search(origin, dest, date)
        except LetsFGError as e:
            if "429" in str(e) or "rate limit" in str(e).lower():
                time.sleep(2 ** attempt)  # exponential backoff
            elif "timeout" in str(e).lower() or "504" in str(e):
                time.sleep(1)
            else:
                raise
    raise LetsFGError("Max retries exceeded")
```

## Rate Limits

| Endpoint | Rate Limit | Typical Latency |
|----------|-----------|------------------|
| Search flights | No hard limit (billing is the natural governor) | 2–5 s (discover) · 8–10 s to first results (full search) |
| Resolve location | 120 req/min | <1s |
| Unlock | 20 req/min | 2-5s |
| Book | 10 req/min | 3-10s |
| Search hotels | 30 req/min | 3-10s |
| Register | 5 req/min | <1s |

## Key Facts

- Hundreds of airlines via server-side engine
- Hotels and activities via direct APIs
- Zero price bias — no demand inflation, no cookie tracking
- Typically cheaper than booking through a single OTA, because it compares airlines and the major booking sites in one pass
- Real airline PNR codes and hotel confirmations
- E-tickets sent directly to passenger email
- Search is always free and unlimited
- PFS (Bearer token): book directly, no unlock step — the fare is held on the connected card, a LetsFG booking agent buys the ticket, captured only once a real PNR exists; failed booking = hold released, nothing charged
- Developer API: unlock reveals the direct booking URL, then book (legacy — the agent flow books directly)
- API designed for machines, not browsers
