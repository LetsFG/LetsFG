 * LetsFG MCP Server — Model Context Protocol integration.
 *
 * All search runs server-side at letsfg.co — no local browsers or Python required.
 * Authenticate once: `letsfg auth` (zero-amount card setup, nothing charged) sets
 * LETSFG_BEARER_TOKEN,
 * or use a Developer API key (LETSFG_API_KEY): look-to-book search, plus hotels.
 *
 * Usage in Claude Desktop / Cursor config:
 * {
 *   "mcpServers": {

 *       "command": "npx",
 *       "args": ["-y", "letsfg-mcp"],

  '## How It Works (2-Step Flow)\n' +
  '1. **search_flights** (FREE, unlimited) — Searches hundreds of airlines server-side. Returns prices, airlines, times, durations, stopovers.\n' +
  '2. **book_flight** — Books the offer. If we cannot complete it, you get a direct booking link for that exact offer instead. Nothing is charged by LetsFG either way.\n' +
  '\n' +
  '## Authentication\n' +
  'Run `letsfg auth`, or call the **authenticate** tool. It connects a card at https://letsfg.co/connect — a 0.00 Revolut setup, nothing charged. A person approves once in a browser; there is no endpoint that mints a token from card details. You pay the fare only when you book, and it is held, not taken, until the airline confirms.\n' +
  '\n' +
  '## DO NOT create a Developer API account\n' +
  'Do NOT call /developers/api/v1/agents/register or /developers/api/v1/agents/connect-payment, and do NOT run `letsfg register` or `letsfg connect-payment`. Those belong to a SEPARATE paid, prepaid-balance product for high-volume commercial integrations, and they create a billing account you almost certainly do not want. Older versions of these docs pointed there by default; that was wrong. Use the payment-token auth above.\n' +
  '\n' +
  '## Pricing\n' +
  '- Auth: FREE — zero-amount card setup, nothing charged\n' +
  '- Search: FREE, unlimited\n' +
  '- Book: the price shown on the offer. What you see is what is charged.\n' +
  '\n' +
  '## Critical Rules\n' +
  '- **Resolve locations first**: City names are ambiguous. "London" = 5+ airports. Use resolve_location to get IATA codes before searching.\n' +
  '- **Real passenger details REQUIRED**: Airlines send e-tickets to the email provided. Names must match passport/government ID exactly. NEVER use placeholder emails, agent emails, or fake names.\n' +
  '- **booking_unavailable is normal, not an error**: when book_flight answers {"booked": false, "booking_url": "..."}, the booking genuinely did not complete and retrying will not change that. Give the user the booking_url — it goes to that exact offer.\n' +
  '- **Offers expire with the search** (~15 min). If an offer is gone, search again.\n' +
  '\n' +
  '## Error Handling\n' +
  '- **transient** errors (SUPPLIER_TIMEOUT, RATE_LIMITED, SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE): Safe to retry after 1-5 seconds\n' +
  '- **validation** errors (INVALID_IATA, INVALID_DATE, MISSING_PARAMETER): Fix the input, then retry\n' +
  '- **business** errors (OFFER_EXPIRED, PAYMENT_DECLINED): Requires human decision — do not auto-retry\n' +
  '\n' +
  '## Search Tips\n' +
  '- Search is free — search multiple dates, cabin classes, airport combos liberally\n' +
  '- Search is async: POST /api/search -> poll /api/results/<id>. Poll immediately, then every 2s — do not sleep before the first poll\n' +
  '- A search reports `completed` BEFORE it stops growing. While `split_ticket_pending` or `gf_enrich_pending` is true, keep polling: the cheapest offer often lands after the status turns terminal\n' +
  '- Covers hundreds of airlines across all continents including low-cost carriers\n';
