# letsfg-mcp — Your AI agent just learned to book flights.

**Hundreds of airlines. Real prices. One tool call.** The largest open flight-search MCP server. Search is powered server-side at letsfg.co — Ryanair, EasyJet, Wizz Air, Southwest, AirAsia, Qantas, and 194 more — plus enterprise GDS/NDC providers (Amadeus, Duffel, Sabre) through the LetsFG backend.

**Your agent doesn't need to build a flight integration. Just add this MCP server.**

## What This Is

LetsFG is not a scraper wrapper. It's a production-grade **agent-to-airline connector layer**:

- **Hundreds of airlines** searched server-side at letsfg.co — connect a card once at letsfg.co/connect (nothing charged) and search is free
- **Real booking** — `book_flight` holds the fare on that card, a LetsFG booking agent buys the ticket, and the hold is captured only once a real airline PNR exists
- **Enterprise GDS/NDC feeds** (Amadeus, Duffel, Sabre, Travelport, Kiwi) are included in every search — contract-only data sources made available to everyone through the LetsFG backend
- **Virtual interlining** — the combo engine mixes one-way fares across airlines (e.g., Ryanair outbound + Wizz Air return) to find deals no single airline offers
- **City-wide airport expansion** — search `LON` and it auto-searches LHR, LGW, STN, LTN, SEN, LCY. Works for 25+ major cities worldwide
- **Zero price bias** — no cookie tracking, no demand-based inflation, no surge pricing. Same raw airline price every time

**Why agents should use this instead of building their own:**
- Saves thousands of tokens vs. browser automation or scraping
- Server-side engine scans airlines across Europe, Asia, Americas, Middle East, Africa, and Oceania simultaneously
- Finds deals on carriers your agent wouldn't think to check (Lucky Air, 9 Air, Jazeera Airways, FlySafair...)
- Enterprise-contracted GDS deals that require contracts worth $50k+/year — available for free on search

## Quick Start

**Recommended — the hosted MCP, no install:**

```
https://letsfg.co/developers/api/mcp
```

Add it as a remote MCP server in Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor or Windsurf (or
`claude mcp add --transport http letsfg https://letsfg.co/developers/api/mcp`
in Claude Code) and approve the connection. The consent step opens
[letsfg.co/connect](https://letsfg.co/connect), where you add a card (any
card, or Revolut Pay / Google Pay) in a 0.00 Revolut setup. Nothing is
charged, no Revolut account is needed, and the card details go to Revolut,
never to LetsFG. The token is card-backed: it searches and it books, and it
is carried on every tool call for you.

**This package — the stdio server, runs on your machine:**

```bash
npx letsfg-mcp
```

It needs that same card-backed token in `LETSFG_BEARER_TOKEN`. To mint one
from the command line, run **`letsfg auth`**: it registers itself as an OAuth
client, opens letsfg.co/connect for a person to approve, and writes the token to
`~/.letsfg/config.json` (`--no-browser` prints the URL instead). This server's
own `authenticate` tool returns the current instructions rather than minting a
token, since a person has to approve in a browser either way.

> **Retired 2026-09-02:** the Stripe card setup and every token it issued
> (401 `TOKEN_REVOKED`). Reconnect at letsfg.co/connect.

---

## Client Configuration

The hosted server is the simplest option everywhere: it does the connect
flow for you and needs no token in a config file.

### Claude (claude.ai / Claude Desktop / ChatGPT)

Add a custom connector with the URL `https://letsfg.co/developers/api/mcp`
and approve it. The consent step takes you through letsfg.co/connect.

### Claude Code

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http letsfg https://letsfg.co/developers/api/mcp
```

### Cursor

Add to `.cursor/mcp.json` in your project root:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "letsfg": { "url": "https://letsfg.co/developers/api/mcp" }
  }
}
```

### Windsurf

Add to `~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "letsfg": { "serverUrl": "https://letsfg.co/developers/api/mcp" }
  }
}
```

### The stdio server instead (`npx letsfg-mcp`)

Same shape in any of the files above, with the card-backed token from the
connect flow in the environment (a paid Developer API key in
`LETSFG_API_KEY` also works, on that separate product):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "letsfg": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "letsfg-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "LETSFG_BEARER_TOKEN": "eyJ..."
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Continue

Add to `~/.continue/config.yaml`:

```yaml
mcpServers:
  - name: letsfg
    command: npx
    args: ["-y", "letsfg-mcp"]
    env:
      LETSFG_BEARER_TOKEN: eyJ...
```

### Any MCP-Compatible Agent

Connect via remote MCP (no install, does the card connect for you):

```
https://letsfg.co/developers/api/mcp
```

Or run the stdio server with a token in `LETSFG_BEARER_TOKEN`:

```bash
npx letsfg-mcp
```

### Windows — `npx ENOENT` Fix

If you get `spawn npx ENOENT` on Windows, use the full path to `npx`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "letsfg": {
      "command": "C:\\Program Files\\nodejs\\npx.cmd",
      "args": ["-y", "letsfg-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "LETSFG_BEARER_TOKEN": "eyJ..."
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Or use `node` directly:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "letsfg": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["C:\\Users\\YOU\\AppData\\Roaming\\npm\\node_modules\\letsfg-mcp\\dist\\index.js"],
      "env": {
        "LETSFG_BEARER_TOKEN": "eyJ..."
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Pin a Specific Version

To avoid unexpected updates:

```json
{
  "command": "npx",
  "args": ["-y", "letsfg-mcp@1.0.0"]
}
```

## Available Tools

| Tool | Description | Cost | Side Effects |
|------|-------------|------|--------------|
| `search_flights` | Search hundreds of airlines via server-side engine | FREE | None (read-only) |
| `resolve_hotel_city` | Place name -> supplier city id | FREE | None (read-only) |
| `search_hotels` | Search bookable, free-cancellation hotel rates | Free up to 1,000/booking, then $5/1,000 — needs a card on file | Opens a supplier session |
| `book_hotel` | Start a hotel booking (async, returns a job id) | 5% now, balance to the supplier | Charges the card, books the room |
| `get_hotel_booking` | Collect the booking result and pay link | FREE | None (read-only) |
| `cancel_hotel_booking` | Release a reservation | Free until `balance_due_by`, then the hotel's ladder | Cancels the booking |
| `resolve_location` | City name → IATA code | FREE | None (read-only) |
| `book_flight` | Start a real booking: fare held on the connected card, a LetsFG agent buys the ticket, captured on a real PNR | Ticket price (LetsFG's markup is inside the price) | Places a hold, creates the booking |
| `get_flight_booking` | Poll a booking started by `book_flight` until `completed` / `failed` / `needs_attention` | FREE | None (read-only) |
| `unlock_flight_offer` | **Developer API only** — confirm live price, reserve 30 min | 1% fee, min $3 | Confirms price |
| `setup_payment` | **Developer API only** — attach a card to a paid prepaid account. Not how agents connect | FREE | Updates payment |
| `get_agent_profile` | Usage stats & payment status | FREE | None (read-only) |

### Booking Flow

**PFS (card-backed token from letsfg.co/connect):**

```
connect (once)  →  search_flights  →  book_flight  →  get_flight_booking (poll)
  (0.00 setup)        (free)          (hold + agent)     (PNR in 4-11 min)
```

1. `search_flights("LON", "BCN", "2026-06-15")` — server-side search returns offers from hundreds of airlines in 8–10 s to first results; collect late arrivals with `get_flight_results`
2. `book_flight(search_id, offer_id, passengers, contact_email)` — exactly what the website checkout does: the fare plus LetsFG's markup is **held** on the connected card (not taken), a LetsFG booking agent buys the ticket from the seller, and the hold is captured only once a real airline PNR exists. Returns a `booking_ref` within seconds. One traveller per call, with the details an airline checkout asks for (name, date of birth, gender, nationality, email, phone with its country, residence address; passport optional). A missing detail returns `missing_fields` and charges nothing.
3. `get_flight_booking(booking_ref)` every 20–30 s — `booking_in_progress` → `completed` (PNR, captured amount) | `failed` (hold released, nothing charged) | `needs_attention` (a human at LetsFG is checking; do not book again). A booking legitimately takes 4–11 minutes.

No unlock step, no booking-link fallback, no separate LetsFG fee. Never call
`book_flight` twice for the same trip while one is in progress — that would
place a second hold.

> The stdio server books through the same `/api/agent-book` hold + poll flow as the
> hosted MCP: `book_flight` returns a `booking_ref`, then `get_flight_booking`
> reports the outcome. It takes **one passenger per call** and refuses more rather
> than silently booking only the first. (Until 2026-09-02 this package had no
> `get_flight_booking` at all, so a stdio agent could start a booking and never
> learn whether it landed — that is fixed.)

**Developer API (prepaid credits, no per-booking fee):**

Search via the [Developer API](https://letsfg.co/developers) returns direct airline booking URLs on every result — no per-booking checkout step. Use this path when you want raw offers at volume without per-booking fees.

The agent has native tools — no API docs needed, no URL building, no token-burning browser automation.

### Response Mode (Remote MCP only)

`search_flights` and `search_hotels` accept an optional `response_mode` parameter:

| Mode | Default | What's returned | Best for |
|------|---------|----------------|----------|
| `"summary"` | ✅ | Price, airlines, route, departure, stops | Chat, quick comparisons |
| `"full"` | | Everything: segments, durations, conditions, bags, booking URLs | Deep analysis, programmatic use |

**Summary mode** saves tokens by stripping per-segment details, baggage policies, and booking conditions. Ask for `response_mode: "full"` on `search_flights` or `get_flight_results` when you need them.

```jsonc
// summary response (search_flights)
{
  "total_offers": 42,
  "offers": [
    { "id": "off_abc", "price": "€29", "airlines": ["FR"], "route": "STN→BCN", "departure": "06:15", "stops": 0 }
  ],
  "hint": "More offers are still landing — call get_flight_results before recommending."
}
```

---

## Starlink Wi-Fi

Offers may carry `starlink`: `confirmed_all` / `confirmed_some` mean the carrier
has **fully** fitted that aircraft type; `likely_all` / `likely_some` mean the
rollout on that type is underway but incomplete. Segments carry `confirmed` or
`likely`.

Only `confirmed_*` is safe to state as fact — `likely_*` is a signal, not a
promise. Anything ending `_some` has at least one leg without it. An **absent**
field means no information, **not** an absence of Wi-Fi.

Full semantics: [docs/api-search.md](https://github.com/LetsFG/LetsFG/blob/main/docs/api-search.md#starlink-wi-fi).

## Get an API Key (Developer API only)

Most agents do not need this: the card-backed token from letsfg.co/connect
already searches and books. An API key belongs to the separate, paid,
prepaid-balance Developer API. If that is what you want, register at
[letsfg.co/developers](https://letsfg.co/developers) or via CLI:

```bash
pip install letsfg
letsfg register --name my-agent --email you@example.com
```

Or directly via the API:

```bash
curl -X POST https://letsfg.co/developers/api/v1/agents/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"agent_name": "my-agent", "email": "agent@example.com"}'
```

## Architecture & Data Flow

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  MCP Client  (Claude Desktop / Cursor / Windsurf / etc.)     │
│     ↕ stdio (JSON-RPC)                                       │

│           search, book (hold → agent → PNR), GDS/NDC feeds    │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

All search and booking run server-side at letsfg.co. No local browsers or scrapers are involved. Connect a card once at letsfg.co/connect (0.00 Revolut setup, nothing charged) and the token is card-backed for search and booking.

### What data goes where

| Operation | Where data flows | What is sent |
|-----------|-----------------|--------------|
| `search_flights` | Your machine → letsfg.co → airlines + GDS providers | Route, date, passenger count |
| `resolve_location` | Your machine → letsfg.co | City/airport name |
| `book_flight` | Your machine → letsfg.co → LetsFG booking agent → seller | Passenger name, DOB, nationality, email, phone, address; the hold goes to Revolut |
| `get_flight_booking` | Your machine → letsfg.co | booking_ref |
| `unlock_flight_offer` / `setup_payment` | Your machine → letsfg.co (Developer API only) | Offer ID / payment token |

---

## Security & Privacy

- **TLS everywhere** — all communication uses HTTPS. The server-side engine connects to airline websites over HTTPS.
- **No card storage** — the card is saved with Revolut at letsfg.co/connect. LetsFG never sees or stores raw card numbers.
- **API key scoping** — `LETSFG_API_KEY` grants access only to your agent's account. Keys are prefixed `letsfg_` for easy identification and revocation.
- **PII handling** — passenger names, emails, and DOBs are sent to the airline for booking (required by airlines). LetsFG does not store passenger PII after forwarding to the airline.
- **No tracking** — no cookies, no session-based pricing, no fingerprinting. Every search returns the same raw airline price.
- **Open source** — the SDK and MCP server code is MIT-licensed and auditable at [github.com/LetsFG/LetsFG](https://github.com/LetsFG/LetsFG).

---

## Sandbox / Test Mode

Search costs nothing, so develop against real results. `book_flight` places a
real hold on a real card; there is no test card on the PFS lane. The paid
Developer API has a keyless sandbox — see
[docs/api-sandbox.md](https://github.com/LetsFG/LetsFG/blob/main/docs/api-sandbox.md).

## FAQ

### `spawn npx ENOENT` on Windows

Windows can't find `npx` in PATH. Use the full path:
```json
"command": "C:\\Program Files\\nodejs\\npx.cmd"
```
Or install globally and use `node` directly (see Windows config above).

### HTTP 403 with an anti-bot challenge page (VPS / datacenter hosts)

If a tool returns `HTTP 403 … an anti-bot challenge page was returned instead of the API`,
the request never reached the search engine — something in the network path in front of
`letsfg.co` answered it, and no token can get past that. It is seen from datacenter and
VPS IPs, which is where MCP servers normally run.

**Upgrade first: `2026.5.74` and later send a declared-bot User-Agent that is not singled
out this way** (`Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; letsfg-mcp/1.3.1; +https://github.com/LetsFG/LetsFG)`).
If you pinned an older version, that is the likeliest cause.

If it still happens, override the User-Agent yourself:

```json
"env": {
  "LETSFG_BEARER_TOKEN": "eyJ...",
  "LETSFG_USER_AGENT": "Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; letsfg-mcp)"
}
```

Please also open an issue with your host and egress IP — the durable fix belongs on our
side, not in your config.

### Search returns 0 results

- Check IATA codes are correct — use `resolve_location` first
- Try a date 2+ weeks in the future (airlines don't sell last-minute on all routes)
- Connect a card through the hosted MCP if you haven't yet — a valid card-backed token is required for free search (`LETSFG_BEARER_TOKEN` for the stdio server)

### How do I get free search without a Developer API key?

Connect LetsFG as an MCP server at `https://letsfg.co/developers/api/mcp` and approve it; the consent step opens letsfg.co/connect, where you add a card in a 0.00 Revolut setup. Nothing is charged and there is no authorization hold. The token you get is card-backed and works for `POST /api/search` and `POST /api/agent-book`. Tokens from the old `letsfg auth` (Stripe) flow were revoked on 2026-09-02 — reconnect.

### Can my agent actually book, or just search?

Book. `book_flight` does what the website checkout does: the fare is held on the connected card, a LetsFG booking agent buys the ticket, and the hold is captured only once a real airline PNR exists — for every offer, not just one supplier. Poll `get_flight_booking` until `completed`; a `failed` booking releases the hold and charges nothing.

### Can I use this for commercial projects?

Yes. MIT license. The SDK, MCP server, and ranking engine are fully open source.

### MCP server hangs on start

Ensure Node.js 18+ is installed. The server communicates via stdio (stdin/stdout JSON-RPC) — it doesn't open a port or print a "ready" message. MCP clients handle the lifecycle automatically.

## 🏨 Hotels — new, and live

Your agent can now book hotels, not just flights. Same API key, same card on file.

```python
from letsfg import LetsFG
lfg = LetsFG()

city = lfg.hotel_destinations("Warsaw")[0]
stays = lfg.search_hotels(
    city_id=city["Id"], city_name=city["Name"],
    check_in="2026-11-10", check_out="2026-11-12", adults=2,
)

hotel = stays["hotels"][0]
offer = hotel["offers"][0]
print(hotel["name"], offer["price"], stays["currency"])
# Hotel Gromada Warszawa Centrum 669.86 PLN

booking = lfg.book_hotel_and_wait(
    session_id=stays["session_id"],
    hotel_code=hotel["hotel_code"],
    combination_id_v2=offer["combination_id_v2"],
    expected_price=offer["price"],
    expected_balance=offer["balance_to_supplier"],
    city_id=city["Id"], city_name=city["Name"],
    check_in="2026-11-10", check_out="2026-11-12",
    guests=[{"title": "Mr", "first_name": "Jan", "last_name": "Kowalski"}],
    email="guest@example.com", phone="512345678",
)
print(booking["confirmation"], booking["pay_link"])
```

### How you pay

**5% now, the rest to the hotel later.** At booking we charge 5% of the price
to your card as a reservation fee. The remaining balance is paid **directly to
the supplier** through a `pay_link` we return — we never hold it.

`balance_due_by` is the supplier's own auto-cancellation date, not a date we
invent. Miss it and the room is released.

The 5% is **non-refundable**. Cancelling before `balance_due_by` costs nothing
else; after it, the hotel's own cancellation ladder applies and can reach 100%.
That ladder ships in the booking's `terms`, so you can always see the cost before
you cancel.

### What search costs

Search is metered separately from booking, on **either** auth path (free PFS
Bearer token or Developer API key — both count against the same agent):
**the first 1,000 `search_hotels` calls since your last hotel booking are
free.** Past that, searches are billed in blocks of 1,000 for **$5**
(~$0.005/search) from your prepaid balance — refused with a 402 if the
balance can't cover the next block, never silently allowed. Book a hotel
and the count resets to zero. Resolving a city name (`resolve_hotel_city`)
is not metered, only the search call itself.

### Things worth knowing before you build

- **A card on file is required for every hotel call, including search.** That is
  unusual and it is deliberate: a hotel search opens a real session at the
  supplier, and booking blocks a real rate. We would rather refuse up front than
  let you reach the point of commitment and discover you cannot pay. The same
  card that authorises flight booking authorises hotels — there is no separate
  hotel signup.
- **Only free-cancellation, pay-later rates are sold.** Those are the rates where
  the balance can safely be settled with the supplier after booking, which is
  what makes 5%-now/rest-later work at all. You will see fewer results than a
  metasearch shows you. Every one of them can actually be booked.
- **Booking is asynchronous.** `book_hotel` returns a `booking_job_id`, not a
  booking — the real thing takes minutes. Poll `hotel_booking(job_id)` until
  `status` is `succeeded` or `failed`, or call `book_hotel_and_wait` and let the
  SDK do it. This is not ceremony: it is what makes it impossible to charge a
  card and then lose the confirmation to a timeout.
- **The fee is charged before the room is committed.** A declined card therefore
  costs nothing to unwind — no reservation exists and nothing is charged.
- **Do not retry a booking blindly.** Calling `book_hotel` twice for the same
  rate books the room twice and charges two reservation fees.
- `price` is what the guest pays. There is no wholesale figure in the response to
  quote by mistake.

### JavaScript

```javascript
import { LetsFG } from 'letsfg';
const lfg = new LetsFG({ apiKey: process.env.LETSFG_API_KEY });

const [city] = await lfg.hotelDestinations('Warsaw');
const stays = await lfg.searchHotels({
  cityId: city.Id, cityName: city.Name,
  checkIn: '2026-11-10', checkOut: '2026-11-12', adults: 2,
});

const booking = await lfg.bookHotelAndWait({ /* ...offer + guest details... */ });
console.log(booking.confirmation, booking.pay_link);
```

### MCP

Five new tools, in the order you call them: `resolve_hotel_city` →
`search_hotels` → `book_hotel` → `get_hotel_booking` → `cancel_hotel_booking`.
