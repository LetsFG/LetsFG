# LetsFG — Your AI agent just learned to book flights.

**Server-side engine. Real prices. One function call.** Search hundreds of airlines at raw airline prices — **$20–$50 cheaper** than Booking.com, Kayak, and other OTAs.

## Two ways to use LetsFG

| | **CLI / SDK** (PFS Bearer token) | **Developer API** |
|---|---|---|
| **Search cost** | Free (card-backed token from [letsfg.co/connect](https://letsfg.co/connect), nothing charged) | Prepaid credits |
| **Booking** | `POST /api/agent-book` — fare held on your card, a LetsFG agent buys the ticket, captured only on a real PNR. Every offer. | `POST /flights/book` — the same hold-then-capture flow, no unlock step, no booking or transaction fee |
| **Speed** | 8–10 s to first results; longer on a split | 2–5 s (discover) · 8–10 s to first results (full) |
| **Setup** | `pip install letsfg`, then connect at [letsfg.co/developers/api/mcp](https://letsfg.co/developers/api/mcp) | [letsfg.co/developers](https://letsfg.co/developers) |

> **Building a product, or need hotels?** Use the [Developer API](https://letsfg.co/developers) — look-to-book search (200 free after every booking, then $0.01), booking through `POST /flights/book`, no booking fee and no transaction fee.

## Install

```bash
pip install letsfg
```

Connect a card once at [letsfg.co/connect](https://letsfg.co/connect) (nothing
charged — see Authentication), then search is free and booking runs on that card:

```bash
export LETSFG_BEARER_TOKEN=eyJ...     # the card-backed token from the connect flow
letsfg search LHR BCN 2026-06-15
```

**Search is free and the price you saw is the price charged.** There is no unlock
step, no booking fee and no transaction fee on any path — our margin is already
included in every offer price. The Developer API works the same way: no booking
fee and no transaction fee, with the margin already inside the offer price. Its
unlock step and 1% (min $3) fee were retired on 2026-09-08.

## Authentication

Connect LetsFG as an MCP server at `https://letsfg.co/developers/api/mcp` and
approve the connection — in Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor, Windsurf, or Claude Code
(`claude mcp add --transport http letsfg https://letsfg.co/developers/api/mcp`).
The consent step opens [letsfg.co/connect](https://letsfg.co/connect), where you
add a card (any card, or Revolut Pay / Google Pay) in a 0.00 Revolut setup.
Nothing is charged, no Revolut account is needed, and the card details go to
Revolut, never to LetsFG. The token you get back is card-backed: it searches
and it books. One card = one account; quotas are per card (10 searches per
10 min, 30 per hour, 100 per day — polling never counts).

The SDK reads the token from `LETSFG_BEARER_TOKEN` or `~/.letsfg/config.json`.

Or skip the MCP client entirely and run **`letsfg auth`**, which does the same
connect flow from the terminal: it registers itself as an OAuth client (PKCE +
loopback redirect), opens the card screen for a person to approve, and writes
the token to `~/.letsfg/config.json`. Add `--no-browser` to print the URL
instead of opening one. The access token lasts about an hour and refreshes
itself from a stored 30-day refresh token — call `ensure_bearer_token()` in a
long-lived process and it renews silently.

```bash
letsfg auth                # opens a browser
letsfg auth --no-browser   # prints the URL to open yourself
```

> **Retired 2026-09-02:** the Stripe enrolment lanes (`setup_url`,
> `setup_session_id`, `payment_method_id`, `card_token`) and every token they
> issued (401 `TOKEN_REVOKED`). `verify_payment_method()` now raises and says
> so. There is no endpoint that mints a token from card details — a person
> must approve once in a browser, so never ask a user for a card number.

```python
from letsfg import LetsFG

# Reads LETSFG_BEARER_TOKEN (or ~/.letsfg/config.json)
bt = LetsFG()
```

Prefer the paid Developer API instead? Register there and pass an `api_key` —
`search()`/`book()` dispatch automatically based on which credential is set:

```python
# Register (one-time, no auth needed) — Developer API only, most agents don't need this
creds = LetsFG.register("my-agent", "agent@example.com")
bt = LetsFG(api_key=creds["api_key"])  # or set LETSFG_API_KEY env var

# Connect a Revolut payment method (nothing is charged to connect)
# POST /agents/connect-payment returns a one-time link; open it in a browser.
# setup_payment() below calls the RETIRED Stripe route and now answers 410 Gone.
```

> Payments moved to Revolut on 2026-09-08. `setup_payment()` and the hosted-checkout lane were
> retired with Stripe and answer `410 Gone` naming the replacement:
> `POST /agents/connect-payment`, then open the returned `connect_url` once in a browser.

### Verify Your Credentials

```python
# Check that auth + payment are working
profile = bt.me()
print(f"Agent: {profile['agent_name']}")
print(f"Payment: {profile.get('payment_status', 'not set up')}")
print(f"Searches: {profile.get('search_count', 0)}")
```

### Auth Failure Recovery

```python
from letsfg.connectors.auth import BearerTokenError
from letsfg import LetsFG

try:
    bt = LetsFG()
    flights = bt.search("LHR", "JFK", "2026-04-15")
except BearerTokenError:
    print("Token missing or revoked — reconnect at https://letsfg.co/connect through the MCP")
```

## Quick Start (Python)

```python
from letsfg import LetsFG

bt = LetsFG()  # reads LETSFG_BEARER_TOKEN

# Search flights — FREE
flights = bt.search("GDN", "BER", "2026-03-03")
print(f"{flights.total_results} offers, cheapest: {flights.cheapest.summary()}")

# Book — no booking fee, no transaction fee — our margin is already in the price you saw; no unlock step. Starts the booking:
# the fare is HELD on your card and a LetsFG agent buys the ticket (4-11 min).
result = bt.book(
    offer_id=flights.cheapest.id,
    passengers=[{
        "given_name": "John",
        "family_name": "Doe",
        "born_on": "1990-01-15",
        "gender": "m",
        "nationality": "GB",
        "phone_number": "+447700900123",
        "phone_country": "GB",
        "address_line1": "1 Analytical Way",
        "address_city": "London",
        "address_postal": "N1 9GU",
        "address_country": "GB",
    }],
    contact_email="john@example.com",
    search_id=flights.search_id,
)
booking_ref = result["booking_ref"]

# Poll until it lands (every 20-30 s): completed | failed | needs_attention
import time, requests
from letsfg.connectors.auth import get_bearer_token
while True:
    status = requests.post(
        "https://letsfg.co/api/agent-book/status",
        json={"booking_ref": booking_ref},
        headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {get_bearer_token()}"},
    ).json()
    if status["state"] != "booking_in_progress":
        break
    time.sleep(25)
print(status)  # {"state": "completed", "pnr": "ABC123", "charged_amount": 93, "currency": "EUR"}
```

### How booking works

`book()` posts to `POST /api/agent-book` and does exactly what the website
checkout does: the fare plus LetsFG's markup is **held** on the connected card
(not taken), a LetsFG booking agent buys the ticket from the seller, and the
hold is captured only once a real airline PNR exists. If the booking fails the
hold is released and nothing is charged. Every offer can be booked this way —
no unlock step, no booking-link fallback, no separate LetsFG fee.

The call returns within seconds with a `booking_ref`; the booking itself takes
4–11 minutes. Poll `POST /api/agent-book/status` with `{"booking_ref": ...}`
every 20–30 s (the SDK has no helper for this yet):

| `state` | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `booking_in_progress` | the agent is at the seller's checkout — keep waiting |
| `completed` | booked — `pnr`, `charged_amount`, `currency` are in the answer |
| `failed` | not booked — the hold was released, nothing charged; see `failure_reason` |
| `needs_attention` | a human at LetsFG is checking it — do **not** book again |

One traveller per call, with the details an airline checkout asks for: name,
date of birth, gender, nationality, email, phone with its country, residence
address (passport optional). A missing detail returns `missing_details` with
`missing_fields` and charges nothing. Never start a second booking for the
same trip while one is in progress — that would place a second hold.

## Multi-Passenger Search

Searching with multiple passengers works on both paths. Booking more than one
passenger in a single call is **Developer API only** — the free PFS `book()`
books one passenger per call.

```python
# 2 adults + 1 child, round-trip, premium economy
flights = bt.search(
    "LHR", "JFK", "2026-06-01",
    return_date="2026-06-15",
    adults=2,
    children=1,
    cabin_class="W",  # W=premium, M=economy, C=business, F=first
    sort="price",
)

# passenger_ids will be ["pas_0", "pas_1", "pas_2"]
print(f"Passenger IDs: {flights.passenger_ids}")

# Developer API: book with details for EACH passenger. No unlock step.
booking = bt.book(
    offer_id=flights.cheapest.id,
    search_id=flights.search_id,
    passengers=[
        {"id": "pas_0", "given_name": "John", "family_name": "Doe", "born_on": "1990-01-15", "gender": "m", "title": "mr"},
        {"id": "pas_1", "given_name": "Jane", "family_name": "Doe", "born_on": "1992-03-20", "gender": "f", "title": "ms"},
        {"id": "pas_2", "given_name": "Tom", "family_name": "Doe", "born_on": "2018-05-10", "gender": "m", "title": "mr"},
    ],
    contact_email="john@example.com",
)
```

## Resolve Locations

Always resolve city names to IATA codes before searching:

```python
locations = bt.resolve_location("New York")
# [{"iata_code": "JFK", "name": "John F. Kennedy", "type": "airport", "city": "New York"}, ...]

# Use in search
flights = bt.search(locations[0]["iata_code"], "LAX", "2026-04-15")
```

## Working with Search Results

```python
flights = bt.search("LON", "BCN", "2026-04-01", return_date="2026-04-08", limit=50)

# Iterate all offers
for offer in flights.offers:
    print(f"{offer.owner_airline}: {offer.currency} {offer.price}")
    print(f"  Route: {offer.outbound.route_str}")
    print(f"  Duration: {offer.outbound.total_duration_seconds // 3600}h")
    print(f"  Stops: {offer.outbound.stopovers}")
    print(f"  Refundable: {offer.conditions.get('refund_before_departure', 'unknown')}")
    print(f"  Changeable: {offer.conditions.get('change_before_departure', 'unknown')}")

# Filter: direct flights only
direct = [o for o in flights.offers if o.outbound.stopovers == 0]

# Filter: specific airline
ba = [o for o in flights.offers if "British Airways" in o.airlines]

# Filter: refundable only
refundable = [o for o in flights.offers if o.conditions.get("refund_before_departure") == "allowed"]

# Sort by duration
by_duration = sorted(flights.offers, key=lambda o: o.outbound.total_duration_seconds)

# Cheapest offer
print(f"Best: {flights.cheapest.price} {flights.cheapest.currency}")
```

## Starlink Wi-Fi

Offers may carry `starlink`: `confirmed_all` / `confirmed_some` mean the carrier
has **fully** fitted that aircraft type; `likely_all` / `likely_some` mean the
rollout on that type is underway but incomplete. Segments carry `confirmed` or
`likely`.

Only `confirmed_*` is safe to state as fact — `likely_*` is a signal, not a
promise. Anything ending `_some` has at least one leg without it. An **absent**
field means no information, **not** an absence of Wi-Fi.

Full semantics: [docs/api-search.md](https://github.com/LetsFG/LetsFG/blob/main/docs/api-search.md#starlink-wi-fi).

## Error Handling

```python
from letsfg import LetsFG, LetsFGError
from letsfg.connectors.auth import BearerTokenError

bt = LetsFG()  # reads LETSFG_BEARER_TOKEN (or ~/.letsfg/config.json)

# Handle invalid locations
try:
    flights = bt.search("INVALID", "JFK", "2026-04-15")
except LetsFGError as e:
    if e.status_code == 422:
        # Resolve the location first
        locations = bt.resolve_location("London")
        flights = bt.search(locations[0]["iata_code"], "JFK", "2026-04-15")

# Handle booking (PFS path — no unlock step)
try:
    result = bt.book(
        offer_id=flights.cheapest.id, passengers=[...],
        contact_email="...", search_id=flights.search_id,
    )
    if result.get("error") == "missing_details":
        print(f"Ask the traveller for: {result['missing_fields']}")  # nothing charged
    elif result.get("error") == "payment_method_required":
        print(f"No card connected — {result['add_card_url']}")
    else:
        print(f"Started: {result['booking_ref']} — poll /api/agent-book/status")
except BearerTokenError:
    print("Token missing or revoked — reconnect at https://letsfg.co/connect")
```

Developer API path adds `unlock()` before `book()`, and its own error modes:

```python
from letsfg import LetsFG, LetsFGError, PaymentRequiredError, OfferExpiredError

bt = LetsFG(api_key="letsfg_...")
try:
    booking = bt.book(offer_id=offer_id, search_id=search_id,
                      passengers=[...], contact_email="...")
except PaymentRequiredError:
    print("Run bt.connect_payment() and open the connect_url it returns")
except OfferExpiredError:
    print("Offer expired — search again and book from the fresh results")
except LetsFGError as e:
    print(f"API error ({e.status_code}): {e.message}")
```

| Exception | HTTP Code | Cause |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| `AuthenticationError` | 401 | Missing or invalid API key (Developer API) |
| `BearerTokenError` | 401 | Missing, expired or revoked Bearer token — reconnect through the MCP (PFS) |
| `PaymentRequiredError` | 402 | No payment method (call `connect_payment()`, Developer API) |
| `OfferExpiredError` | 410 | Offer no longer available (Developer API) |
| `LetsFGError` | any | Base class for all API errors |

### Timeout and Retry Pattern

Full cloud search takes 8–10 s to first results (async polling). Use retry with backoff for transient errors:

```python
import time
from letsfg import LetsFG, LetsFGError

bt = LetsFG()

def search_with_retry(origin, dest, date, max_retries=3):
    """Retry with exponential backoff on rate limit or timeout."""
    for attempt in range(max_retries):
        try:
            return bt.search(origin, dest, date)
        except LetsFGError as e:
            if "429" in str(e) or "rate limit" in str(e).lower():
                wait = 2 ** attempt  # 1s, 2s, 4s
                print(f"Rate limited, waiting {wait}s...")
                time.sleep(wait)
            elif "timeout" in str(e).lower() or "504" in str(e):
                print(f"Timeout, retrying ({attempt + 1}/{max_retries})...")
                time.sleep(1)
            else:
                raise
    raise LetsFGError("Max retries exceeded")
```

### Rate Limits

| Endpoint | Rate Limit | Typical Latency |
|----------|-----------|------------------|
| Search | No hard limit (billing is the natural governor) | 8–10 s to first results |
| Resolve location | 120 req/min | < 1 s |
| Unlock | 20 req/min | 2–5 s |
| Book | 10 req/min | 3–10 s |

## Search Wide, Book Once

Searching is free (10 per 10 min, 30 per hour, 100 per day per card). On
PFS, booking goes through `POST /api/agent-book` — the fare is held on your
card and captured only on a real PNR. No booking fee, no transaction fee — our margin is already in the price you saw.
Compare before booking:

```python
# Search multiple dates (free) — compare before booking
dates = ["2026-04-01", "2026-04-02", "2026-04-03"]
best = None
for date in dates:
    result = bt.search("LON", "BCN", date)
    if result.offers and (best is None or result.cheapest.price < best[1].price):
        best = (date, result)

# Book only the winner
if best:
    date, result = best
    booking = bt.book(
        offer_id=result.cheapest.id, passengers=[...],
        contact_email="...", search_id=result.search_id,
    )
```

On the Developer API the same idea applies to the look-to-book allowance: 200
searches are free after every booking, so search every candidate, then book the
winner — the booking resets the allowance.

## Quick Start (CLI)

```bash
# Token: connect once through the MCP (see Authentication), then
export LETSFG_BEARER_TOKEN=eyJ...

# Search (1 adult, one-way, economy — defaults)
letsfg search GDN BER 2026-03-03 --sort price

# Multi-passenger round trip
letsfg search LON BCN 2026-04-01 --return 2026-04-08 --adults 2 --children 1 --cabin M

# Business class, direct flights only
letsfg search JFK LHR 2026-05-01 --adults 3 --cabin C --max-stops 0

# Machine-readable output (for agents) — includes search_id, needed for book
letsfg search LON BCN 2026-04-01 --json

# Book — no booking fee, no transaction fee — our margin is already in the price you saw; no unlock step. Holds the fare on
# your card and starts the LetsFG booking agent; prints the booking_ref to poll.
letsfg book off_xxx --search-id srch_xxx \
  --passenger '{"given_name":"John","family_name":"Doe","born_on":"1990-01-15","gender":"m","nationality":"GB","phone_number":"+447700900123","phone_country":"GB","address_line1":"1 Analytical Way","address_city":"London","address_postal":"N1 9GU","address_country":"GB"}' \
  --email john@example.com

# Resolve location
letsfg locations "Berlin"
```

### Search Flags

| Flag | Short | Default | Description |
|------|-------|---------|-------------|
| `--return` | `-r` | _(one-way)_ | Return date YYYY-MM-DD |
| `--adults` | `-a` | `1` | Adults (1–9) |
| `--children` | | `0` | Children 2–11 years |
| `--cabin` | `-c` | _(any)_ | `M` economy, `W` premium, `C` business, `F` first |
| `--max-stops` | `-s` | `2` | Max stopovers (0–4) |
| `--currency` | | `EUR` | Currency code |
| `--limit` | `-l` | `20` | Max results (1–100) |
| `--sort` | | `price` | `price` or `duration` |
| `--json` | `-j` | | Raw JSON output |

## All CLI Commands

| Command | Description | Cost |
|---------|-------------|------|
| `auth` | Connect a card at letsfg.co/connect and store the token — self-registers, PKCE + loopback redirect, opens a browser. `--no-browser` prints the URL | FREE |
| `search` | Search flights between any two airports, prints `search_id` | FREE |
| `locations` | Resolve city name to IATA codes | FREE |
| `book` | Start a booking for an offer from your search (`--search-id` required). Fare held on your card, captured on a real PNR; poll `/api/agent-book/status` | No booking fee, no transaction fee |
| `me` | Show agent profile and usage stats | FREE |
| `unlock` | **RETIRED 2026-09-08** — prints the replacement and exits non-zero. There is no unlock step | — |
| `register` | **[Developer API only]** Register new Developer API key | FREE |
| `connect-payment` | **[Developer API only]** Print a link for connecting a payment method. Nothing is charged. `setup-payment` is an alias | FREE |

Every command supports `--json` for machine-readable output.

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `LETSFG_BEARER_TOKEN` | PFS Bearer token (card-backed, from the connect flow). Takes priority over `~/.letsfg/config.json`. |
| `LETSFG_API_KEY` | Developer API key (look-to-book search + booking) |
| `LETSFG_BASE_URL` | API URL override (default: `https://letsfg.co`) |

## How It Works

1. **Search** — Free. The server-side engine queries hundreds of airlines and returns real-time offers.
2. **Book** — Call `POST /api/agent-book` with your Bearer token. The fare plus LetsFG's markup is held on your connected card, a LetsFG booking agent buys the ticket from the seller, and the hold is captured only once a real airline PNR exists (4–11 minutes; poll `POST /api/agent-book/status`). A failed booking releases the hold. Ticket price only, no LetsFG fee, no unlock step.

The Developer API is a separate product with the same booking model. Search there is
**look-to-book**: 200 searches free after every booking you make, then blocks of 500 for $5.00
($0.01 each). Booking is `POST /flights/book` — the fare is held on a connected Revolut method and
captured only against a real PNR, with **no booking fee and no transaction fee**; the margin is
inside the price the search returned.

> Retired 2026-09-08: the `unlock` step (and its 1% / min $3 fee) no longer exists, and neither do
> the Stripe onboarding routes. Both answer `410 Gone` naming their replacement. See
> <https://letsfg.co/developers/api/docs>.

## 🏨 Hotels — new, and live

Your agent can now book hotels, not just flights. Same API key, same connected payment method.

```python
from letsfg import LetsFG
lfg = LetsFG()

city = lfg.hotel_destinations("Warsaw")[0]
stays = lfg.search_hotels(
    city_id=city["Id"], city_name=city["Name"],
    check_in="2026-11-10", check_out="2026-11-12", adults=2,
)

hotel = stays["hotels"][0]
offer = hotel["offers"][0]
print(hotel["name"], offer["price"], offer["currency"], offer["refundable"])
# prices are in stays["currency"]: USD unless you pass currency=

booking = lfg.book_hotel_and_wait(
    session_id=offer["session_id"],
    hotel_code=hotel["hotel_code"],
    combination_id_v2=offer["combination_id_v2"],
    expected_price=offer["price"],          # copy these four from the offer, verbatim
    expected_cost=offer["expected_cost"],
    currency=offer["currency"],
    fx_rate=offer["fx_rate"],
    city_id=city["Id"], city_name=city["Name"],
    check_in="2026-11-10", check_out="2026-11-12",
    guests=[{"title": "Mr", "first_name": "Jan", "last_name": "Kowalski"}],
    email="GUEST_EMAIL", phone="512345678",   # the guest's real e-mail and phone
)
if booking["status"] == "succeeded":
    print(booking["confirmation"], booking["total_price"], booking["currency"])
elif booking["status"] == "failed":
    print("Not booked, nothing charged:", booking["error"])
else:  # "attention": a person is checking it with the supplier, the hold is kept. Do not book again.
    print(booking["status"], booking.get("error"))
```

### How you pay

**The full price is held, and taken only once the hotel confirms.** Booking holds the offer's
`price` on the Revolut payment method connected to your account — authorised, not charged.
LetsFG then books the room with the supplier and pays the supplier itself. The hold is captured
only after the supplier has confirmed the booking; if the booking fails for any reason (the rate
is gone, the price moved, the supplier declined, a guest detail was rejected), the hold is
released and nothing is charged.

There is **no reservation fee, no deposit and no pay link**, and the guest owes the hotel nothing
further. (Those belonged to the process retired on 2026-09-11.)

`price` is the supplier's cost plus 6.4% (our margin and payment processing) for Revolut Pay or a
card issued in the EEA, or 8.3% for a card issued outside the EEA — the search response's
`markup_rate` says which. Nothing is added at booking. Prices are in the currency you search in:
USD unless you ask for another.

Cancelling a refundable rate before its `free_cancellation_until` costs nothing and refunds the
charge in full. A cancellation that would cost money is refused (409); the hotel's own ladder is in
the booking's `terms`.

### What search costs

Search is metered separately from booking, on **either** auth path (free PFS
Bearer token or Developer API key — both count against the same agent):
**the first 1,000 `search_hotels` calls since your last hotel booking are
free.** Past that, searches are billed in blocks of 1,000 for **$5**
(~$0.005/search) from your prepaid balance — refused with a 402 if the
balance can't cover the next block, never silently allowed. Book a hotel
and the count resets to zero. Resolving a city name (`hotel_destinations`)
is not metered, only the search call itself.

### Things worth knowing before you build

- **A connected payment method is required for every hotel call, including search.** A hotel
  search opens a real session at the supplier and booking blocks a real rate, so we refuse up
  front rather than let you reach the point of commitment and discover you cannot pay. The same
  method authorises flights and hotels — there is no separate hotel signup.
- **Every rate type is sold**, refundable and non-refundable. Each offer's `refundable` and
  `free_cancellation_until` say which one you are buying.
- **Booking is asynchronous.** `book_hotel` returns a `booking_job_id`, not a booking — the real
  thing takes minutes. Poll `hotel_booking(job_id)` every ~20 s until `status` is `succeeded`,
  `failed` or `attention`, or call `book_hotel_and_wait` and let the SDK do it. All three are final:
  - `succeeded` — `confirmation`, `total_price` + `currency` (what the guest is charged),
    `supplier_paid` + `supplier_currency`, `refundable`, `free_cancellation_until`,
    `cancellation_ladder` and `terms`.
  - `failed` — `error`, written for the guest. The hold has been released; nothing was charged.
  - `attention` — the outcome could not be settled automatically. The hold is kept (nothing is
    charged) while a person checks with the supplier. Do not book again.
- **Copy the offer verbatim.** Send `expected_price` (the offer's `price`), `expected_cost`,
  `currency` and `fx_rate` exactly as search returned them. A mis-copied price, or a USD offer sent
  without its `currency`, is refused with `400 price_mismatch` before anything is held.
- **Guest details are checked before anything is held**: Latin-script names, a phone number valid
  for its country code, and an e-mail. A problem returns `400 invalid_details` naming the fields.
- **The guest is e-mailed however it ends**: a confirmation with the code and the cancellation
  term, a note that it did not go through and nothing was charged, or a note that it is being
  confirmed with the supplier.
- **A retry never books twice.** A second `book_hotel` for the same rate and guest returns the job
  already under way (`duplicate: true`); pass `idempotency_key` to make that explicit. Still, never
  re-post a booking whose job is running — poll it.

### JavaScript

```javascript
import { LetsFG } from 'letsfg';
const lfg = new LetsFG({ apiKey: process.env.LETSFG_API_KEY });

const [city] = await lfg.hotelDestinations('Warsaw');
const stays = await lfg.searchHotels({
  cityId: city.Id, cityName: city.Name,
  checkIn: '2026-11-10', checkOut: '2026-11-12', adults: 2,
});

const hotel = stays.hotels[0];
const offer = hotel.offers[0];
const booking = await lfg.bookHotelAndWait({
  sessionId: offer.session_id, hotelCode: hotel.hotel_code,
  combinationIdV2: offer.combination_id_v2,
  expectedPrice: offer.price, expectedCost: offer.expected_cost,
  currency: offer.currency, fxRate: offer.fx_rate,
  cityId: city.Id, cityName: city.Name,
  checkIn: '2026-11-10', checkOut: '2026-11-12',
  guests: [{ title: 'Mr', first_name: 'Jan', last_name: 'Kowalski' }],
  email: 'GUEST_EMAIL', phone: '512345678',
