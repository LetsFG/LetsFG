# LetsFG — Your AI agent just learned to book flights. (Node.js)

**Server-side search engine. Real prices. One function call.** Search hundreds of airlines at raw airline prices — **$20–$50 cheaper** than Booking.com, Kayak, and other OTAs. Zero dependencies. Built for AI agents.

## Two ways to use LetsFG

| | **CLI / SDK** (this package) | **Developer API** |
|---|---|---|
| **Search cost** | Free (Twitter/X Bearer token via `letsfg auth`) | Prepaid credits |
| **Booking** | `POST /api/agent-book` | Direct airline URL |
| **Speed** | 60–90 s | 2–5 s (discover) · 60–90 s (full) |
| **Setup** | `npm install letsfg` then `letsfg auth` | [letsfg.co/developers](https://letsfg.co/developers) |

> **Want direct airline URLs without any per-booking fee?** Use the [Developer API](https://letsfg.co/developers) — prepaid credits, results in seconds, no checkout step.

## Install

```bash
npm install letsfg
```

## Quick Start (SDK)

```typescript
import { LetsFG, cheapestOffer, offerSummary } from 'letsfg';

// Register (one-time)
const creds = await LetsFG.register('my-agent', 'agent@example.com');
console.log(creds.api_key); // Save this

// Use
const bt = new LetsFG({ apiKey: 'trav_...' });

// Search — FREE
const flights = await bt.search('GDN', 'BER', '2026-03-03');
const best = cheapestOffer(flights);
console.log(offerSummary(best));

// Unlock
const unlock = await bt.unlock(best.id);

// Book
const booking = await bt.book(
  best.id,
  [{
    id: flights.passenger_ids[0],
    given_name: 'John',
    family_name: 'Doe',
    born_on: '1990-01-15',
    gender: 'm',
    title: 'mr',
    email: 'john@example.com',
  }],
  'john@example.com'
);
console.log(`PNR: ${booking.booking_reference}`);
```

## Quick Start (CLI)

```bash
export LETSFG_BEARER_TOKEN=<your-bearer-token>

letsfg search GDN BER 2026-03-03 --sort price
letsfg search LON BCN 2026-04-01 --json  # Machine-readable
letsfg unlock off_xxx
letsfg book off_xxx -p '{"id":"pas_xxx","given_name":"John",...}' -e john@example.com
```

## API

## 🏨 Hotels — new, and live

Your agent can now book hotels, not just flights. Same API key, same card on file.

```python
from letsfg import LetsFG
lfg = LetsFG()

city = lfg.hotel_destinations("Warsaw")[0]
stays = lfg.search_hotels(
    city_id=city["Id"], city_name=city["Name"],
    check_in="2026-11-10", check_out="2026-11-12", adults=2,
)

hotel = stays["hotels"][0]
offer = hotel["offers"][0]
print(hotel["name"], offer["price"], stays["currency"])
# Hotel Gromada Warszawa Centrum 669.86 PLN

booking = lfg.book_hotel_and_wait(
    session_id=stays["session_id"],
    hotel_code=hotel["hotel_code"],
    combination_id_v2=offer["combination_id_v2"],
    expected_price=offer["price"],
    expected_balance=offer["balance_to_supplier"],
    city_id=city["Id"], city_name=city["Name"],
    check_in="2026-11-10", check_out="2026-11-12",
    guests=[{"title": "Mr", "first_name": "Jan", "last_name": "Kowalski"}],
    email="guest@example.com", phone="512345678",
)
print(booking["confirmation"], booking["pay_link"])
```

### How you pay

**10% now, the rest to the hotel later.** At booking we charge 10% of the price
to your card as a reservation fee. The remaining balance is paid **directly to
the supplier** through a `pay_link` we return — we never hold it.

`balance_due_by` is the supplier's own auto-cancellation date, not a date we
invent. Miss it and the room is released.

The 10% is **non-refundable**. Cancelling before `balance_due_by` costs nothing
else; after it, the hotel's own cancellation ladder applies and can reach 100%.
That ladder ships in the booking's `terms`, so you can always see the cost before
you cancel.

### Things worth knowing before you build

- **A card on file is required for every hotel call, including search.** That is
  unusual and it is deliberate: a hotel search opens a real session at the
  supplier, and booking blocks a real rate. We would rather refuse up front than
  let you reach the point of commitment and discover you cannot pay. The same
  card that authorises flight booking authorises hotels — there is no separate
  hotel signup.
- **Only free-cancellation, pay-later rates are sold.** Those are the rates where
  the balance can safely be settled with the supplier after booking, which is
  what makes 10%-now/rest-later work at all. You will see fewer results than a
  metasearch shows you. Every one of them can actually be booked.
- **Booking is asynchronous.** `book_hotel` returns a `booking_job_id`, not a
  booking — the real thing takes minutes. Poll `hotel_booking(job_id)` until
  `status` is `succeeded` or `failed`, or call `book_hotel_and_wait` and let the
  SDK do it. This is not ceremony: it is what makes it impossible to charge a
  card and then lose the confirmation to a timeout.
- **The fee is charged before the room is committed.** A declined card therefore
  costs nothing to unwind — no reservation exists and nothing is charged.
- **Do not retry a booking blindly.** Calling `book_hotel` twice for the same
  rate books the room twice and charges two reservation fees.
- `price` is what the guest pays. There is no wholesale figure in the response to
  quote by mistake.

### JavaScript

```javascript
import { LetsFG } from 'letsfg';
const lfg = new LetsFG({ apiKey: process.env.LETSFG_API_KEY });

const [city] = await lfg.hotelDestinations('Warsaw');
const stays = await lfg.searchHotels({
  cityId: city.Id, cityName: city.Name,
  checkIn: '2026-11-10', checkOut: '2026-11-12', adults: 2,
});

const booking = await lfg.bookHotelAndWait({ /* ...offer + guest details... */ });
console.log(booking.confirmation, booking.pay_link);
```
