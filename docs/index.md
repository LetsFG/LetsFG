> ### ⚠️ Agents: do not create a Developer API account
>
> Do **NOT** call `/developers/api/v1/agents/register` or
> `/developers/api/v1/agents/setup-payment`, and do **NOT** run
> `letsfg register` or `letsfg setup-payment`. Those belong to a separate,
> paid, prepaid-balance product for high-volume commercial integrations and
> create a billing account you almost certainly do not want.
>
> To search and book flights, connect LetsFG as an MCP server at
> <https://letsfg.co/developers/api/mcp>. The consent step opens
> <https://letsfg.co/connect>, where a card is saved (nothing is charged).
> See <https://letsfg.co/for-agents>.

    <h1>Search hundreds of airlines server-side at letsfg.co — and book. Free with a card-backed token. Move to the prepaid Developer API for direct booking URLs and volume access.</h1>
    <p class="docs-lead">LetsFG has two paths. Connect the MCP server at <code>letsfg.co/developers/api/mcp</code> once — the consent step saves a card at <code>letsfg.co/connect</code>, nothing is charged — and search and book for free from Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor, Windsurf or the SDK. If you want account-managed access, direct airline booking URLs, or billing controls, use the developer surface on letsfg.co, attach a payment method, top up balance, and then search with your developer key.</p>

## Two paths to LetsFG

LetsFG has two access paths — pick the one that matches your setup:

| Path | How | Speed | Search cost | Booking |
|------|-----|-------|-------------|---------|
| **MCP / SDK** (connect at [letsfg.co/connect](https://letsfg.co/connect)) | Server-side search + booking; one-time 0.00 card setup during the MCP consent → card-backed token | 8–10 s to first results; longer to `completed`, longer again on a split | Free | Fare held on the card, captured only against a real PNR; no separate LetsFG fee |
| **Developer API** ([letsfg.co/developers](https://letsfg.co/developers)) | Runs on our servers with prepaid credits | 2–5 s (discover) · 8–10 s to first results (full search) | Prepaid credits | Direct airline booking URLs, no per-booking fee |

**When to choose each:**
- Use **MCP / SDK** if you want free search and booking — add `https://letsfg.co/developers/api/mcp` to your assistant and approve it once ([letsfg.co/for-agents](https://letsfg.co/for-agents)), then search and book server-side for free. `book_flight` / `POST /api/agent-book` holds the fare on the connected card and a LetsFG booking agent buys the ticket — no unlock step, no LetsFG fee on top of the price you saw.
- Use the **Developer API** if you're building a product or need high volume without per-booking fees. Prepaid credits, results in seconds, direct airline URLs every time.

    <h2>Search and book free after a one-time connect</h2>
    <p>Add the MCP server at <code>letsfg.co/developers/api/mcp</code> and approve it. The consent step opens <code>letsfg.co/connect</code>, where a card is saved in a 0.00 setup (nothing is charged). All search runs server-side at letsfg.co — no local browsers required.</p>
    <ul class="docs-check-list">
      <li><code>search_flights</code>, <code>book_flight</code> and <code>get_flight_booking</code> over the MCP; <code>bt.search()</code> / <code>bt.book()</code> with the same token in <code>LETSFG_BEARER_TOKEN</code></li>
      <li>Search is free: 10 per 10 min, 30 per hour, 100 per day per card</li>

<div class="docs-callout">
  <strong>Important:</strong> the public developer API is not anonymous search. Search requests are rejected until the developer account has an API key, a payment method, and funded prepaid balance.

## Public API onboarding

<div class="docs-step-strip">
  <span class="docs-step">1. Register</span>
  <span class="docs-step-arrow">/</span>
  <span class="docs-step">2. Attach Stripe payment</span>
  <span class="docs-step-arrow">/</span>
  <span class="docs-step">3. Top up balance</span>
  <span class="docs-step-arrow">/</span>
  <span class="docs-step">4. Search</span>
  <span class="docs-step-arrow">/</span>
  <span class="docs-step">5. Check account state</span>
</div>

The canonical public surfaces are:

- API root: [letsfg.co/developers/api](https://letsfg.co/developers/api)
- OpenAPI JSON: [letsfg.co/developers/api/openapi.json](https://letsfg.co/developers/api/openapi.json)
- Swagger UI: [letsfg.co/developers/api/docs](https://letsfg.co/developers/api/docs)

## Hotels

Hotels are live: real bookable inventory, free-cancellation and pay-later rates only, 5% charged at booking as a non-refundable reservation fee and the balance paid straight to the supplier through a pay link. They need a card on file for every call, search included — and either credential reaches them: the card-backed token from the connect step or a Developer API key. Start at [Hotels](hotels.md).
