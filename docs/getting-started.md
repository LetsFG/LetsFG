# Getting Started

> ### ⚠️ Agents: do not create a Developer API account
>
> Do **NOT** call `/developers/api/v1/agents/register` or
> `/developers/api/v1/agents/connect-payment`, and do **NOT** run
> `letsfg register` or `letsfg connect-payment`. Those belong to a separate,
> paid, prepaid-balance product for high-volume commercial integrations and
> create a billing account you almost certainly do not want.
>
> To search and book flights, connect LetsFG as an MCP server at
> <https://letsfg.co/developers/api/mcp>. Approving it opens
> <https://letsfg.co/connect>: one tap, no card. A card is asked for at the first booking.

<div class="docs-callout">
  <strong>Pick the correct path first.</strong> Use Option A (free Bearer token) if you want search and booking with no billing account. Use Option B (Developer API) if you want managed billing or account-level controls. Hotels work on either.

## Choose the right mode

| Mode | Best for | Setup | Search cost | Booking |
|------|----------|-------|-------------|---------|
| MCP / SDK (card-backed token) | Agents, assistants, zero-cost search and booking | Connect the MCP at `letsfg.co/developers/api/mcp` (one tap, no card); the card is added at the first booking | Free | `book_flight` / `POST /api/agent-book` — fare held on the card, captured against a real PNR |
| Public Developer API | Managed cloud search, products, teams, hotels | Register, then connect a Revolut method (nothing charged) | Look-to-book: 200 free after every booking, then $5.00 per 500 | `POST /flights/book` — fare held on the connected method, captured against a real PNR. No booking fee, no transaction fee |
| Hotels | Booking a room, not a flight | Either credential + a connected card | 1,000 searches free after every hotel booking | Price held on the connected method, captured once the hotel confirms |

**Hotels work on the same credential.** They accept either the card-backed PFS token or a
Developer API key, and need a card on file — which the connect step already saves. See
[Hotels](hotels.md).

## Option A: Free search and booking with a card-backed token

All search runs server-side at letsfg.co. No local browsers or Playwright required.

### 1. Connect once

Connect LetsFG as an MCP server at `https://letsfg.co/developers/api/mcp` and approve the connection. The consent step opens <https://letsfg.co/connect>: one tap, no card. The card is asked for at your first booking, in a 0.00 Revolut setup — any card, or Revolut Pay / Google Pay; no Revolut account needed, and the card details go to Revolut, never to LetsFG. Nothing is charged until you book, and even then the money is held, not taken, until the airline confirms.

That works in claude.ai, Claude Desktop, Claude Code (`claude mcp add --transport http letsfg https://letsfg.co/developers/api/mcp`), ChatGPT, Cursor, Windsurf — anything that speaks remote MCP with OAuth. Over the MCP the token is carried for you. Over raw HTTP send it as `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.

> Prefer the terminal? **`letsfg auth`** (npm or PyPI) runs the same connect flow: it registers itself as an OAuth client, opens the connect screen for a person to approve, and writes the token to `~/.letsfg/config.json`. `--no-browser` prints the URL instead. The SDK and CLI otherwise read the token from `LETSFG_BEARER_TOKEN` or `~/.letsfg/config.json`. The old Stripe card setup was retired on 2026-09-02 together with every token it issued.

### 2. Search

> Find me the cheapest flight from London to Barcelona on June 15

Or from the CLI / SDK with the token in the environment:

```bash
pip install letsfg
export LETSFG_BEARER_TOKEN=eyJ...
letsfg search LHR BCN 2026-06-15
```

```python
from letsfg import LetsFG

bt = LetsFG()  # uses LETSFG_BEARER_TOKEN from environment
result = bt.search("GDN", "BCN", "2026-06-15")
for offer in result.offers[:5]:
    print(f"{offer.airlines[0]}: {offer.currency} {offer.price}")
```

Search is free: 10 per 10 minutes, 30 per hour, 100 per day per card. Polling results never counts.

### 3. Book

Booking works exactly like the website checkout, on the connected card. The price shown is **held** (not taken), a LetsFG booking agent buys the ticket from the seller, and the hold is captured only once a real airline PNR exists. If the booking fails, the hold is released and nothing is charged. Every offer a search returns is bookable this way — there is no unlock step and no separate LetsFG fee.

Over the MCP: `book_flight` starts it and returns a `booking_ref` within seconds; poll `get_flight_booking` every 20–30 s. A booking takes 4–11 minutes.

Over HTTP, the same two calls:

```bash
# Step 1 — start (one traveller per call; real details, the e-ticket goes to contact_email)
curl -X POST https://letsfg.co/api/agent-book \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer eyJ..." \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"search_id":"ws_abc123","offer_id":"ws_off_...",
       "contact_email":"traveller@example.com",
       "passenger":{"given_name":"Ada","family_name":"Lovelace","born_on":"1990-04-01",
                    "gender":"f","nationality":"GB","phone_number":"+15551234567",
                    "phone_country":"US","address_line1":"1 Analytical Way",
                    "address_city":"London","address_postal":"N1 9GU","address_country":"GB"}}'
# → {"booking_ref":"eyJ...","state":"booking_in_progress"}

# Step 2 — poll every 20-30 s
curl -X POST https://letsfg.co/api/agent-book/status \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer eyJ..." \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"booking_ref":"eyJ..."}'
# → {"state":"completed","pnr":"ABC123","charged_amount":93,"currency":"EUR"}
```

`state` walks `booking_in_progress` → `completed` (PNR, captured amount) | `failed` (hold released, nothing charged, `failure_reason`) | `needs_attention` (a human at LetsFG is checking it — do not book again). A missing passenger field answers `missing_details` with `missing_fields` and charges nothing. Never start a second booking for the same trip while one is in progress.

## Option B: Public developer API

Use this path if you want account-managed cloud search through the website-owned developer API.

### 1. Register and keep the API key

```bash
curl -X POST https://letsfg.co/developers/api/v1/agents/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"agent_name": "my-agent", "email": "you@example.com"}'
```

Expected response fields include `agent_id`, `api_key`, `tier` and `payment_ready` (false until a Revolut method is connected).

### 2. Connect a Revolut payment method

```bash
curl -X POST https://letsfg.co/developers/api/v1/agents/connect-payment \
  -H "X-API-Key: letsfg_your_api_key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"return_url": "https://example.com/account"}'
```

Open the returned `connect_url` in a browser and save a card or Revolut Pay.
**Nothing is charged to connect.** The link lasts one hour, and a connected
method is what opens search.

> Stripe was retired on 2026-09-08. `setup-payment` and `hosted-checkout` answer
> `410 Gone` naming this replacement.

### 3. Fund prepaid balance (optional)

Only needed once you exceed the free look-to-book allowance — 200 searches after
every booking. Balance buys further blocks of 500 for $5.00.

```bash
curl -X POST https://letsfg.co/developers/api/v1/agents/top-up \
  -H "X-API-Key: letsfg_your_api_key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"amount_cents": 2500}'
```

Balance is not needed to start: a connected method opens search, and the free look-to-book allowance covers it until it runs out.

### 4. Run the first public search

```bash
curl -X POST https://letsfg.co/developers/api/v1/flights/search \
  -H "X-API-Key: letsfg_your_api_key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"origin": "LHR", "destination": "JFK", "date_from": "2026-07-15", "adults": 1, "currency": "USD"}'
```

### 5. Inspect account status

```bash
curl https://letsfg.co/developers/api/v1/agents/me \
  -H "X-API-Key: letsfg_your_api_key"
```

The profile response shows whether payment is ready, whether API access is enabled, and how much prepaid balance remains.

## Common mistakes

| Problem | What it means | What to do |
|---------|---------------|------------|
| `401 API key is required` | Search was attempted without `X-API-Key` | Register first and send the returned key |
| `402 payment_method_required` | No Revolut method connected | `POST /agents/connect-payment`, open the `connect_url` |
| `402 search_allowance_exhausted` | The look-to-book allowance is used up | Book a flight (resets it) or `POST /agents/top-up` to buy a block |
| `410` on `setup-payment` / `hosted-checkout` | Retired with Stripe on 2026-09-08 | Call `POST /agents/connect-payment` and open the `connect_url` |
