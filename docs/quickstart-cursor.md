# Cursor — 5-Minute Quickstart

> ### ⚠️ Agents: do not create a Developer API account
>
> Do **NOT** call `/developers/api/v1/agents/register` or
> `/developers/api/v1/agents/setup-payment`, and do **NOT** run
> `letsfg register` or `letsfg setup-payment`. Those belong to a separate,
> paid, prepaid-balance product for high-volume commercial integrations and
> create a billing account you almost certainly do not want.
>
> To search and book flights, connect LetsFG as an MCP server at
> <https://letsfg.co/developers/api/mcp>. The consent step opens
> <https://letsfg.co/connect>, where a card is saved (nothing is charged).
> See <https://letsfg.co/for-agents>.

Connect the remote MCP server once and Cursor's agent can search and book flights, and search and book hotels. Nothing to install.

## Option A: Remote MCP with the connect flow — **recommended**

### 1. Add to Cursor MCP config

Create `.cursor/mcp.json` in your project root (or the global config):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "letsfg": {
      "url": "https://letsfg.co/developers/api/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Approve the connection

Cursor prompts you to authenticate the server. The consent step opens <https://letsfg.co/connect>, where you add a card or pay 0.00 with Revolut Pay / Google Pay. Any card works, no Revolut account is needed, and the card details go to Revolut — they never touch LetsFG.

Nothing is charged to connect. You pay the ticket price only when you book, and even then the money is held, not taken, until the airline confirms. The token Cursor receives is card-backed and is carried on every tool call.

### 3. Reload Cursor

Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` → `Developer: Reload Window`. LetsFG tools appear in the MCP panel.

### 4. Search

> Find me flights from Berlin to Lisbon on April 10

Search is free: 10 per 10 minutes, 30 per hour, 100 per day per card.

## Option B: Local MCP server (`npx letsfg-mcp`)

Use this only if you cannot use a remote server. It needs a card-backed token in its environment — the one issued through the connect flow above (`letsfg auth`, the old Stripe setup, was retired on 2026-09-02; a connect-flow login for the CLI is coming).

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "letsfg": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "letsfg-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "LETSFG_BEARER_TOKEN": "your_card_backed_token"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

> **Windows `ENOENT` fix:** Replace `"npx"` with `"C:\\Program Files\\nodejs\\npx.cmd"`.

Reload the window. The local server sends every request to the letsfg.co server-side engine with your token — no local browsers.

---

## Option C: Paid Developer API — *not for agents*

The same remote URL also accepts a Developer API key in an `X-API-Key` header, from the separate, prepaid product at [letsfg.co/developers](https://letsfg.co/developers). It creates a billing account and blocks search until you fund it. See [Onboarding and Billing](api-onboarding.md) if you are building a commercial integration.

## Use in Agent mode

Cursor's Agent mode can chain LetsFG tools automatically:

> "I need to fly from San Francisco to Tokyo next month. Find the cheapest option, show me the details, and book it for me."

The agent will:
1. `resolve_location("San Francisco")` → SFO
2. `search_flights("SFO", "TYO", "2026-05-01")`, then `get_flight_results` for the late-landing split tickets
3. Present options with prices
4. Ask for the traveller's real details (name as on the passport, date of birth, gender, nationality, email, phone, address)
5. `book_flight` — the fare plus LetsFG's markup is held on your card, a LetsFG booking agent buys the ticket, and the hold is captured only against a real airline PNR. If it fails, the hold is released and nothing is charged
6. `get_flight_booking` every 20–30 s until `completed` with the PNR (a booking takes 4–11 minutes)

## Troubleshooting

**"payment_method_required" with an `add_card_url`** → the connection has no card yet. Open <https://letsfg.co/connect> from the consent step and add one; nothing is charged.

**"TOKEN_REVOKED"** → a token from the retired Stripe setup. Remove and re-add the server so the consent step saves the card again.

**"Connect a payment method and fund your prepaid API balance before searching"** → you are on the paid Developer API key (Option C), not the connect flow. Remove the `X-API-Key` header, or fund the account.

**Tools not appearing** → Check `.cursor/mcp.json` is valid JSON. Reload window.

**"Cannot start Python"** -> the local server needs Node (`npx`); the remote MCP URL needs nothing installed

**Windows: `spawn npx ENOENT`** → Use full path: `"C:\\Program Files\\nodejs\\npx.cmd"`
