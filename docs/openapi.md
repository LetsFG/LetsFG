# OpenAPI and Swagger

<div class="docs-callout">
  <strong>Use the website-owned schema.</strong> The canonical public contract lives at <code>https://letsfg.co/developers/api/openapi.json</code>. Treat that as the live machine-readable surface, not the old raw repository link.

## Which URL does what?

| Surface | Best for |
|---------|----------|
| `https://letsfg.co/developers/api/openapi.json` | Machine-readable schema for generators, SDK tooling, and agent discovery |
| `https://letsfg.co/developers/api/docs` | Interactive Swagger UI |
| `https://letsfg.co/developers/api/v1` | The actual REST base for requests |
| `https://letsfg.co/en/developers` | Human onboarding, hosted checkout, and account context |

## What is in the live schema?

The live public schema currently includes paths for:

- `POST /agents/register`
- `POST /agents/hosted-checkout`
- `POST /agents/hosted-checkout/complete`
- `POST /agents/setup-payment`
- `POST /agents/top-up`
- `POST /agents/billing-portal`
- `POST /agents/billing-settings`
- `POST /agents/rotate-key`
- `GET /agents/me`
- `POST /flights/search`
- `GET /flights/locations/{query}`
- `GET /flights/providers`

## Fetch the schema

```bash
curl https://letsfg.co/developers/api/openapi.json | jq '.info, .servers'
```

List the documented paths:

```bash
curl https://letsfg.co/developers/api/openapi.json | jq '.paths | keys'
```

## Why this matters

- The website-owned schema matches the public proxy rules for auth and billing.
- It stays aligned with the website developer surface that agents actually use.
- Direct backend hosts are not the canonical public integration contract.

## Current public API scope

The public schema currently covers:

- developer registration and hosted onboarding
- Stripe payment attachment for API-only onboarding
- prepaid balance funding and billing settings
- flight search, location resolution, and provider inspection
