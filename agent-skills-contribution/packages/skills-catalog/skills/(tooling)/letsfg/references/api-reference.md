# LetsFG API Reference

Full endpoint details for the LetsFG flight search and booking API.

**Base URL:** `https://letsfg.co/developers/api/v1`

## Authentication

All endpoints (except `register`) require the `X-API-Key` header:

```
X-API-Key: trav_your_api_key
```

## Endpoints

### Register Agent

```
POST /api/v1/agents/register
```

No auth required.

```json
{
  "agent_name": "my-agent",
  "email": "agent@example.com"
}
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "agent_id": "ag_xxx",
  "api_key": "trav_xxxxx..."
}
```

### Connect Payment

```
POST /api/v1/agents/connect-payment
```

```json
{
  "status": "connect_required",
  "connect_url": "https://letsfg.co/connect?dev=sess_abc123",
  "expires_in_seconds": 3600
}
```

Open `connect_url` in a browser once and save a card or Revolut Pay. **Nothing is charged to
connect.** A connected method is what opens search, and it is what bookings and top-ups are
charged to. The link lasts one hour; connecting again replaces the previous method.

> `POST /api/v1/agents/setup-payment` was retired on 2026-09-08 with Stripe and answers `410 Gone`.

Answers `202` in seconds with a `booking_id`; the booking itself takes 4-11 minutes.

The connected Revolut method is **held, not charged**. A LetsFG booking agent buys the ticket and
the hold is captured **only against a real airline PNR**; a failed booking releases it. The offer
price already includes LetsFG's margin, so there is no booking fee and no transaction fee. A
completed booking also resets the free search allowance to 200.

1 to 9 passengers. Only `given_name` is required by the schema — the server answers `400
missing_fields` naming exactly what an airline checkout still needs, before anything is charged.
Always send an `idempotency_key`: a retry with the same key returns the existing booking instead of
opening a second hold.

### Poll a Booking

```
GET /api/v1/flights/bookings/{booking_id}
```

Poll until `terminal` is true. States: `authorised`, `card_issued`, `booking_in_progress`,
`awaiting_settlement`, then `completed` (with `pnr` and `charged_amount`), `failed` (hold released,
nothing charged) or `needs_attention` (a human at LetsFG is on it — do not book again).

Polling is also how LetsFG knows you are still there, which keeps a paused booking alive.

### Answer a Booking Question

```
POST /api/v1/flights/bookings/{booking_id}/answer
```

While `booking_in_progress`, `question` may carry a seat map (`kind: "seat"`), a paid extra
(`"extra"`) or a fare increase (`"price_change"`). Echo its `round` — a stale round is refused with
`409` rather than guessed at.

```json
{"round": 2, "confirm": true}
```

`{"skip": true}` declines an extra or skips seat selection; the booking still completes.

### Retired

`POST /api/v1/bookings/unlock`, `POST /api/v1/bookings/book` and
`GET /api/v1/bookings/booking/{id}` were retired on 2026-09-08 and answer `410 Gone` naming their
replacement. There is no unlock step on either lane any more.
