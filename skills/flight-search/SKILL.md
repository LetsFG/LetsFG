  Search and book flights across hundreds of airlines plus the major booking sites, with
  than OTAs. Returns raw airline prices via the letsfg.co server-side search engine.
  Use when user asks to "find flights",
  "search flights", "book a flight", "compare airline prices", "find cheap flights",
  "fly from X to Y", "find connections", "find layover options", or any flight-related
  travel query. Do NOT use for hotels (use the hotel-search skill), car rentals, or

# Flight Search

> **MPP:** a card-free *enrolment* lane for agents holding a Tempo wallet is
> offered only when the `402` from `POST /api/agent-access/request` carries an
> `mpp` object. It costs **$0.01 once**, as verification only. Search stays free
> and booking costs the price on the offer. Earlier revisions of this page
> described an MPP charge at *unlock* time; that never shipped. See
> <https://letsfg.co/for-agents>.

> ### ⚠️ Agents: do not create a Developer API account
>
> Do **NOT** call `/developers/api/v1/agents/register` or
> `/developers/api/v1/agents/connect-payment`, and do **NOT** run
> `letsfg register` or `letsfg connect-payment`. Those belong to a separate,
> paid, prepaid-balance product for high-volume commercial integrations and
> create a billing account you almost certainly do not want.
>
> To search and book flights, connect LetsFG as an MCP server at
> `https://letsfg.co/developers/api/mcp` and approve it — the consent step saves
> a card at <https://letsfg.co/connect> (nothing charged). Then search and book.

Agent-native flight search and booking via the LetsFG cloud engine. Hundreds of airlines plus the major booking sites,
Compares airlines and the major booking sites in one pass, with per-flight reliability history.

**Agent flow (PFS):** Search (free) → Book (`POST /api/agent-book`, the price shown on the offer) → Poll (`POST /api/agent-book/status`). Booking works exactly like the website checkout: the fare plus LetsFG's markup is held on the card connected at <https://letsfg.co/connect> (not taken), a LetsFG booking agent buys the ticket from the seller, and the hold is captured only once a real airline PNR exists. A failed booking releases the hold — nothing charged. It takes 4–11 minutes; over the MCP the two steps are `book_flight` and `get_flight_booking`. There is no unlock step on either lane.

## Why Use This

- **Hundreds of airlines** — one search covers Europe, Asia, Americas, Middle East, Africa, and Oceania simultaneously
- **Zero price bias** — no demand inflation, no cookie tracking, no surge pricing. Raw airline prices every time
- **Virtual interlining** — finds cross-airline connections (e.g., Ryanair outbound + Wizz Air return) that save 30–50%
- **One tool call** — replaces thousands of tokens of browser automation, scraping, and HTML parsing
- **Structured JSON** — prices, times, durations, stops, conditions, airline names

## Setup

### Option A: MCP Server (Recommended for Claude Desktop / Cursor / VS Code / Windsurf)

**Remote (no install, always latest):**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "letsfg": {
      "url": "https://letsfg.co/developers/api/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "X-API-Key": "trav_your_api_key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Local (stdio):**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "letsfg": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "letsfg-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "LETSFG_API_KEY": "trav_your_api_key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Option B: CLI

```bash
pip install letsfg
letsfg search LHR BCN 2026-06-15
```

### Option C: Python SDK

```python
from letsfg import LetsFG
bt = LetsFG(api_key="trav_...")
flights = bt.search("LHR", "JFK", "2026-04-15")
```

### Get an API Key (Free)

```bash
letsfg register --name my-agent --email agent@example.com
```

Then connect a payment method (nothing is charged; there is no unlock step):

```bash
letsfg connect-payment   # prints a link to open in a browser
```

## Workflow

### 1. Resolve Locations First

City names are ambiguous — "London" = LHR, LGW, STN, LCY, LTN. Always resolve first:

```bash
letsfg locations "London"
# LON  London (all airports)
# LHR  Heathrow
# LGW  Gatwick
```

```python
locations = bt.resolve_location("London")
# Use city code "LON" for all airports, or specific airport "LHR"
```

### 2. Search (FREE, Unlimited)

```python
flights = bt.search("LON", "BCN", "2026-04-01")
# Round trip:
flights = bt.search("LON", "BCN", "2026-04-01", return_date="2026-04-08")
# Multi-passenger, business class:
flights = bt.search("LHR", "SIN", "2026-06-01", adults=2, children=1, cabin_class="C")
```

```bash
letsfg search LON BCN 2026-04-01 --return 2026-04-08 --sort price --json
```

Search returns structured offers:

```json
{
  "passenger_ids": ["pas_0"],
  "total_results": 47,
  "offers": [{
    "id": "off_xxx",
    "price": 89.50,
    "currency": "EUR",
    "airlines": ["Ryanair"],
    "route": "STN → BCN",
    "duration_seconds": 7800,
    "stopovers": 0,
    "conditions": {
      "refund_before_departure": "not_allowed",
      "change_before_departure": "allowed_with_fee"
    }
  }]
}
```

### 3. Unlock — RETIRED 2026-09-08

There is no unlock step on either lane any more, and the route answers `410 Gone`. Unlock existed
to confirm a live price before charging; booking now HOLDS the fare and captures only against a
real airline PNR, so a moved price surfaces as a question to accept or decline rather than a
surprise charge. Call `book_flight` (PFS) or `POST /flights/book` (Developer API) directly.

### 4. Book (the price shown on the offer)

The fare is **held** on the connected card, a LetsFG booking agent buys the ticket, and the hold
is captured only against a real airline PNR; a failed booking releases it. `book()` starts the
booking (4–11 minutes); `book_and_wait()` blocks until it settles.

```python
booking = bt.book(
    offer_id=flights.cheapest.id,
    search_id=flights.search_id,          # an offer is bookable only inside its own search
    passengers=[{
        "id": flights.passenger_ids[0],
        "given_name": "John",
        "family_name": "Doe",
        "born_on": "1990-01-15",
        "gender": "m",
        "title": "mr",
        "email": "john@example.com"
    }],
    contact_email="john@example.com",
    idempotency_key="unique-booking-key-123"
)
print(booking)   # the started booking — poll it until completed | failed | needs_attention
```

## Critical Rules

1. **Use REAL passenger details** — airlines send e-tickets to the contact email. Names must match passport/ID exactly. Never use placeholder or fake data.
2. **Always provide `idempotency_key` when booking** — prevents duplicate reservations if the agent retries on timeout.
3. **Resolve locations before searching** — "New York" = JFK, LGA, EWR, NYC. Use `resolve_location()` first.
4. **Search is free** — search as many routes, dates, and cabin classes as needed.
5. **Map passenger IDs** — search returns `passenger_ids`. Each booking passenger must include the correct `id`.

## Best Practices

### Search Wide, Book Once

```python
# Compare multiple dates (all FREE)
dates = ["2026-04-01", "2026-04-02", "2026-04-03"]
best = None
for date in dates:
    result = bt.search("LON", "BCN", date)
    if result.offers and (best is None or result.cheapest.price < best[1].price):
        # keep the search_id too: an offer is bookable only inside the search that produced it
        best = (date, result.cheapest, result.search_id)

# Book only the winner — there is no unlock step
booking = bt.book(best[1].id, passengers=[{...}], contact_email="you@example.com",
                  search_id=best[2])
```

### Filter Before Booking

```python
flights = bt.search("LHR", "JFK", "2026-06-01", limit=50)

candidates = [
    o for o in flights.offers
    if o.outbound.stopovers == 0
    and o.outbound.total_duration_seconds < 10 * 3600
]

if candidates:
    best = min(candidates, key=lambda o: o.price)
    booking = bt.book(best.id, passengers=[{...}], contact_email="you@example.com",
                      search_id=flights.search_id)
```

### Finding Connections & Multi-Stop Routes

```python
# Search with stops allowed (default max_stopovers=2)
flights = bt.search("GDN", "BKK", "2026-06-15", max_stopovers=2)

# Filter by connection quality
good_connections = [
    o for o in flights.offers
    if o.outbound.stopovers <= 1
    and o.outbound.total_duration_seconds < 18 * 3600
]

# Virtual interlining finds cross-airline combos automatically
# e.g., Wizz Air GDN→VIE + Thai Airways VIE→BKK
```

## Error Handling

| Error | Category | Action |
|-------|----------|--------|
| `SUPPLIER_TIMEOUT` (504) | Transient | Retry after 1-5s |
| `RATE_LIMITED` (429) | Transient | Wait and retry |
| `INVALID_IATA` (422) | Validation | Use `resolve_location()` to fix |
| `OFFER_EXPIRED` (410) | Business | Search again for fresh offers |
| `PAYMENT_REQUIRED` (402) | Business | PFS: connect a card at the `add_card_url` (https://letsfg.co/connect). Developer API: `letsfg connect-payment` |
| `FARE_CHANGED` (409) | Business | The fare moved at checkout — answer the `price_change` question to accept or decline it |

```python
from letsfg import LetsFG, OfferExpiredError, PaymentRequiredError

try:
    booking = bt.book(offer_id, passengers=[{...}], contact_email="you@example.com",
                      search_id=search_id)
except OfferExpiredError:
    # Airline sold the seats — search again and book from the fresh results
    flights = bt.search(origin, dest, date)
except PaymentRequiredError:
    # No card on file — Developer API: letsfg connect-payment; PFS: https://letsfg.co/connect
    print("Connect a card first")
```

## Search Flags

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--return` / `-r` | _(one-way)_ | Return date (YYYY-MM-DD) |
| `--adults` / `-a` | `1` | Number of adults (1–9) |
| `--children` | `0` | Children (2–11 years) |
| `--cabin` / `-c` | _(any)_ | `M` economy, `W` premium, `C` business, `F` first |
| `--max-stops` / `-s` | `2` | Max stopovers (0–4) |
| `--currency` | `EUR` | Currency code |
| `--limit` / `-l` | `20` | Max results (1–100) |
| `--sort` | `price` | `price` or `duration` |
| `--json` / `-j` | | JSON output |

## Safety

| Operation | Cost | Safe to Retry | Idempotent |
|-----------|------|---------------|------------|
| `search` | Free | Yes | Yes |
| `resolve_location` | Free | Yes | Yes |
| `unlock` | **RETIRED 2026-09-08** — answers `410 Gone` | — | — |
| `book` | Price shown on the offer | Developer API: only with `idempotency_key`. PFS: **no** — a second call places a second hold; poll `/api/agent-book/status` instead | With key: yes |
